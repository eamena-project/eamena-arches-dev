Process Indicator/Evidence of Type	نوع مؤشر /أدلة للتغيرات	Definitions	التعريف			
Channel Migration/Abandonment	قناة مائية مهجورة/مجرى نهري مهجور	Evidence indicates that river channels have moved in the past				
Coastal Advance/Accretion	انحسار الساحل/تقدم اليابسة	Evidence indicates that the coastline has advanced (i.e. moved seaward) in the past				
Coastal Retreat/Erosion	تراجع الساحل/تعرية (تقدم البحر)	Evidence indicates that the coastline has retreated (i.e. moved landward) in the past				
High Potential for Archaeological Preservation	امكانية عالية محفوظة للآثار	Evidence suggests the geological deposit/feature under consideration has a high (but not certain) likelihood of containing archaeological material 				
Lake Level Change	تغير مستوى سطح البحيرة	Evidence indicates that the water level of a lake has fluctuated (i.e. risen or fallen) in the past				
Low Potential for Archaeological Preservation	امكانية منخفضة محفوظة للآثار	Evidence suggests the geological deposit/feature under consideration has a low (but not certain) likelihood of containing archaeological material 				
Natural Hazard	خطر طبيعي	Evidence indicates that a natural hazard, such as an earthquake, volcano, tsunamic etc…, has occurred sometime in the past				
Preservation of Organic Remains	بقايا عضوية محفوظة	Evidence suggests the geological deposit/feature under consideration preserves organic material. Note that this includes naturally occuring material (e.g. plant remains) as well as organic archaeological artefacts				
Preservation of Relict Palaeo-landscape Features	معالم أو ظواهر	Evidence indicates that parts of a landscape which existed before the present day, including landforms and sedimentary deposits, are still preserved either on, or buried under, the Earth's surface				
Reworking of Archaeological Deposits	إعادة تعرية وترسيب للبقايا الأثرية	Evidence indicates that although archaeological remains may be present, they are likely reworked (resulting in the loss of spatial relationships) and no longer in situ				
Sea-level Fall	انخفاض مستوى سطح البحر	Evidence indicates that sea-level has fallen in the past				
Sea-level Oscillations	تذبذب مستوى سطح البحر	Evidence indicates that sea-level has risen in the past				
Sea-level Rise	ارتفاع مستوى سطح البحر	Evidence indicates that sea-level has has fluctuated (i.e. risen or fallen) in the past				
Tectonic Subsidence	الهبوط التكتوني	Downward movement of the ground surface due to tectonic processes including both long-term (e.g. plate movement) and short-term (e.g. earthquake)				
Tectonic Uplift	الرفع التكتوني	Upward movement of the ground surface due to tectonic processes including both long-term (e.g. plate movement) and short-term (e.g. earthquake)				
Unknown or n/a	غير محدد أو لا يمكن تحديده	The archaeological or geoscientific implications of the evidence under consideration is unknown
