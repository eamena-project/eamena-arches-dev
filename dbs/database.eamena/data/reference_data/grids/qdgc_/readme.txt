QDGC tables delivered in geopackage file

QDGC represents a way of making (almost) equal area squares covering a specific area to represent specific qualities of the area covered. The squares themselves are based on the degree squares covering earth. Around the equator we have 360 longitudinal lines , and from the north to the south pole we have 180 latitudinal lines. Together this gives us 64800 segments or tiles covering earth.

Within each geopackage file you will find a number of tables with these names:
-tbl_qdgc_01
-tbl_qdgc_02
-tbl_qdgc_03
-tbl_qdgc_04
-tbl_qdgc_05
-etc

The attributes for each table are:
qdgc  Unique Quarter Degree Grid Cell reference string
level_qdgc  QDGC level
cellsize  degrees decimal degree for the longitudal and latitudal length of the cell
lon_center  Longitude center of the cell
lat_center  Latitudal center of the cell
area_km2  Calculated area for the cell
geom  Geometry

Metadata
--------
Geodata GCS_WGS_1984
Datum: D_WGS_1984
Prime Meridian: 0

Areas are calculated with different versions of Albers Equal Area Conic using the PostGIS function st_area. For the African continent I have used Africa Albers Equal Area Conic which will look like this:
- st_area(st_transform(geom, 102022))/1000000)
