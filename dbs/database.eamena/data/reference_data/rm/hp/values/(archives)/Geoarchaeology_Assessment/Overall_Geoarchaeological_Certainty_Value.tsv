Overall Geoarchaeological Certainty Value	درجة التأكد من الملاحظة الجيوأركيولوجية	Definitions	التعريف			
Negligible	ضئيل	There is very weak evidence to suggest that the site/feature has any geological/geoarchaeological significance and it is highly questionable whether the site/feature is of geoarchaeological interest. E.g. informal reports of landforms which may or may not be recent features, or sediments which are likely to have been recently deposited		ضئيل	ok	تافه
Low	ضعيف	There is weak evidence to suggest that the site/feature has any geological/geoarchaeological significance and it is highly questionable whether the site/feature is of geoarchaeological interest.  The site/feature may be unclear on imagery or alternative explanations may be probable. This is probably not a site of geoarchaeological interest, although there has been no fieldwork to verify this. E.g. Landforms which may or may not be recent features but which are clearly visible on satellite imagery or other data sources				
Medium	متوسط	There is evidence to suggest that the site/feature has any geological/geoarchaeological significance. The area has multiple sources of evidence which support each other (e.g. multiple image sets or data types) or is clear enough in a single evidence source to suggest that it is possibly a site of geological/geoarchaeological interest. The area will probably be easy to delimit, but alternative explanations may be possible. There has been no field visit to confirm this interpretation or age. E.g. Landforms which are clearly visible on satellite imagery or other data sources and whose shape and form suggest creation by processes no longer operating at present but which could have occured relatively recently				
High	عالي	There is strong evidence to suggest that the site/feature is archaeological. The area has multiple sources of evidence that support each other (e.g. multiple image sets, multiple data types) or is clear enough in a single evidence source to suggest that it is a site of archaeological interest. The area will probably be easy to delimit and there are no obvious possible. There has been no field visit to confirm this interpretation. E.g. Landforms which are clearly visible on satellite imagery or other data sources and whose shape and form indicate creation by processes no longer operating at present or recent past		عال	no	
Definite	مؤكد	There is definitive evidence to suggest that the site/feature has geological/geoarchaeological signifiance.  The site has been visited and it is confirmed that it is a site of geological/geoarchaeological interest. (Published literature/ Field-visit only)
