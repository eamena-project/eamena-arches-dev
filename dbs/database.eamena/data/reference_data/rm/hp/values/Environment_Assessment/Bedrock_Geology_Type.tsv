Environment Assessment	التقييم البيئي	Unnamed: 2	Unnamed: 3	Alternative suggested translation	MK Comments	Old Term replaced by AB or MK
Igenous (undefined)	نارية (غير محددة)	Rock formed by cooling and solidification of molten rock including within the Earth as well as from eruptions/extrusion of lava. Use this term where the rock is igneous, but the specific type (e.g. basal, granite) is unknown				
Basalt	بازيلت	Dark, fine-grained igeneous rock, generally formed by rapid cooling of lava				
Conglomerate	رصيص	Sedimentary rock containing large gravel sized clasts (>2mm) usually embedded within a matrix of finer grains				
Granite	جرانيت	Coarse-to medium grained igeneous rock, generally formed by slow cooling of molten rock within the Earth's surface 				
Limestone/Chalk/Dolomite	حجر جيري/طباشيري/دولميت	Sedimentary rock produced by the consolidation of carbonate material accumulated from the shells and skeletons  of carbonate-producing organisms (e.g. molluscs, corals, foraminifera)				
Marble	رخام	Metamorphic rock derived from carbonate rocks (e.g. limestone, dolomite)				
Metamorphic (undefined)	صخر متحول	Rock formed by an intense change in heat and pressure applied to a prexisting igneous or sedimentary rock Use this term where the rock is metamorphic but the specific type (e.g. quartzite, schist) is unknown				
Mudstone/Siltstone	حجر طيني/حجر غريني	Fine- to medium grained sedimentary rock produced by the accumulation of mud-sized clasts. Sometimes referred to as shale				
Organic sedimentary rock	صخر رسوبي عضوي	Sedimentary rock produced by the consolidation of organic material accumulated from organic debris such as plant matter. Common types include coal and lignite				
Sandstone	حجر رملي	Fine- to medium grained  sedimentary rock produced by the accumulation and consolidation of sand-sized clasts				
Sedimentary (undefined)	حجر رسوبي (غير محدد)	Rock formed by the accumulation and consolidation of loose sediment orginally deposited by any one, or several, of a range of transport / formation processes. For example including wind action, water action, glacial action, precipiation and biogenic processes. Use this term where the rock is sedimentary but the specific type (e.g. sandstone, shale) is unknown				
Slate	سليت	Fine-grained metamorphic rock derived from mudstone/shale				
Tuff	حجر مسامي/ التوفا	Rock produced by the consolidation of accumulated volcanic material including ash, tephra and lava and often incorporating other rocks or material pre-existing at the point of deposition
