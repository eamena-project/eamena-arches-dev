Monsoon	أمواج موسمية	Seasonally variable waves (moderate in one season, rougher in another season) resulting from monsoon winds which alternate between summer and winter. Found in tropical to subtropical regions.				
Protected	محمي	Area which generally receives limited wave action owing to physical protection from natural topography or artficial (man made) structures, for example an enclosed bay or lagoon 				
Storm Wave	أمواج اعصارية عارمة	Highly variable wave conditions resulting from frequent passage of depression (storms) over the coast. Found in subtropical, temperate and arctic regions				
Swell	أمواج هوجاء	Generally moderate and consistent waves travelling in a constant direction. Usually produced by consistent trade winds and found near the equator and subtropical regions 				
Tide-dominated	خاضعة للمد والجزر	Areas where tidal energy dominated over wave energy (e.g. areas with large tidal ranges) such that tidal processes form the main influence on coastal geomorphology				
Tropical Cyclone	أمواج عاتية بسبب عاصفة مدارية	Rare but very high waves which occur during tropical cyclones (aka typhoons, hurricanes). Impact tropical areas which for the rest of the time are under swell or monsoon wave climates
