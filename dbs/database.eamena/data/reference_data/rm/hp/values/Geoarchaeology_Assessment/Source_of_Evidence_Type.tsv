Geoarchaeology Assessment	تقييم جيوأركيولوجي	Unnamed: 2	Unnamed: 3	Alternative suggested translation	mk comments	Old Term replaced by AB or MK
Aerial/Satellite Image	صورة جوية/قمر صناعي	Image of the Earth's surface taken from above by a spaceborne (satellite) or airborne (aircraft, UAV) camera or image sensor. Defintion here encompasses optical and multispectral images				
Core/Borehole	مجسات سبر بالحفارة	Vertical sample of sediment obtained by drilling or pushing a sampling device vertically into the ground or seabed surface. Provides an indication of stratigraphy as well as physical samples for further analysis 				
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)	ذبذبة رادار أرضية (GPR)	Radar system which images sediment layers and rocks buried under the ground surface, providing information about sediment thickness, stratigraphy and buried features/structures. Data traditionally collected and displayed as 2D (vertical) cross sections, but 3D systems also now exist.				
Micropaleontological Analysis	تحليل بيولوجي دقيق	Sampling and analysis of microfossils (i.e. require a microscope to see) of plants or animals from rocks or sediments, generally for the purpose of reconstructing past environments and environmental change. Analysis can be done of microfossils from both terrestiral and marine environments				
Open Face Section	قطاع أو مسقط مكشوف	Vertical exposure (cross section) on the Earth surface which reveals buried sediments or rock. Can occur naturally (e.g. through coastal or cliff erosion), or by human action (e.g. quarrying, trenching). Provides an indication of stratigraphy, physical samples for further analysis and in some cases, show the shape of buried landforms 				
Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating	التأريخ بالتحفيز البصري للإشعاع الضوئي	Absolute dating method for sediments (and some types of archaeological material) based on measuring the luminescence caused by trapping of electrons within a mineral 				
Other Absolute Dating Method	طرق أخرى للتأريخ المطلق	Any other dating method which provides a numerical date but does not match one of the other terms here				
Radiocarbon Dating	التأريخ بواسطة الكربون	Absolute dating method for organic material based on the radioactive decay of the carbon-14 isotope				
Relative Dating	الـتأريخ النسبي	Dating method which aims to determine the sequential order of past events based on comparison of the stratigraphic position of sediments, rocks or fossils 				
Seafloor Bathymetry	قياس أعماق قاع البحر	Digital Elevation Model of the seabed surface generated by any method, for instance, including swath systems (multibeam echosounder, interferometric sonar), single-beam echosounder, LiDAR, Satellite Derived Bathymetry				
Seismic Profile (Marine)	قطاع ذبذبي (بحري)	Boat deployed acoustic system which images sediment layers and rocks buried under the seabed, providing information about sediment thickness, stratigraphy and buried features/structures. Data traditionally collected and displayed as 2D (vertical) cross sections, but 3D systems also now exist. Also known as a sub-bottom profiler				
Sidescan Sonar	سونار مسح جانبي	Boat-deployed acoustic system which images the seabed surface and provides data in the form of a 2D image. Imagery gives an indication of features on the seafloor and a qualitative impression of sediment type				
Surface Sampling	عينة سطحية	Sediment sample taken from the land or seabed surface by any method. 				
Surface Visual Observations	معاينة بصرية سطحية	Observations of the land or seabed surface made with the naked eye				
Synthetic Aperture Radar	رادار تركيبي الفتحة	Air- or spaceborne radar system which images the land surface and provides data in the form of a 2D image. 2D imagery gives an indication of features on the land surface, additional processing can be used to derive 3D elevation models from the 2D imagery				
Terrestrial Elevation Model	موديل الارتفاع الأرضي	Digital Elevation Model of the land surface generated by any method, for instance, including LiDAR (ground and airborne), orthoimagery, GPS or Structure-From-Motion				
U-series Dating	التأريخ بسلسلة اليورانيوم	Absolute dating method for carbonate material based on the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium isotopes
