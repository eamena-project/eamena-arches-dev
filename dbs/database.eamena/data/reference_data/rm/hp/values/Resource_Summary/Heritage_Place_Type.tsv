Heritage Place Type	نوع الموقع التراثي	Definitions	تعريف			
Archaeological Site	الموقع الأثري	A place or area of archaeological/heritage significance where human activity is represented by material culture. This is the 'default' category to which records should be assigned if you are unsure about its classification.				
Archaeological Feature/Component	الظاهرة/المكون	A place, area, or feature of archaeological/heritage significance which comprises part of a larger place/area/feature of significance, such as a Landscape or Archaeological Site. Records given this classification should always be related to a 'parent' record.				
Landscape/Seascape	لاندسكيب	An area which contains one or more places, areas, and/or features of shared or similar archaeological/heritage significance, but which may be physically separated and spread over a large area				
Urban Heritage	موقع تراثي حضري	A place, area, or feature of archaeological/heritage significance which is located within a contemporary urban area, and which is often (but not necessarily) still in current use				
Structural Heritage	مبنى تراثي	"A building or other construction of archaeological/heritage significance, which is still, at least partially, standing. This term should be used only when the entire record is documenting this type of heritage, not for cases where structures just happen to present as part of a larger or more complex site. E.g. an ancient city may have many individual buildings which can be recorded as ""Structural Heritage"" if given individual records, but the city itself is made of many different types of features, and should be recorded overall as an ""Archaeological Site""."
