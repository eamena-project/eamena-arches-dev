# KAHD v2

Arches v7.3

## Specs

1x t4g.xlarge instance prepaid (upfront) 3 years  with  an additional 1 TB storage S3.
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
64-bit ARM
in eu-west-1*
Offering class = convertible
- Data transfer: I see no DT in i-0241ae4481c39a055, so I assume there will have no DT neither
- No EBS snapshots. We plan to do backups of a database only (not the instance itself)
- Elastic IP: only one
