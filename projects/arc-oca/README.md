## arch-oca
> Oxford Computational Archaeology (OCA)

The `arch-oca` project, host by the [Oxford ARC](https://www.arc.ox.ac.uk/home), aims to integrate different archaeological projects using computer science and data management as the main working tools. The expected archaeological projects are those that require the development of computer scripts (in particular Python and R), as well as advanced computer science. Particular emphasis will be placed on the interoperability of computer tools and the reusability of research results. Topics include (but are not limited to): AI/ML, open source web database management, open software development, data versioning, and creating interactive data-driven documents.
