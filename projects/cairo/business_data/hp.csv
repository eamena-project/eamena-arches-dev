A similar gate, now unused, is placed on the opposite side, in the northern end of the north-eastern wall. The spacious courtyard includes four richly decorated marble cenotaphs and five limestone tomb markers, where the oldest tomb marker dates back to 1323 Hijri.

The relieving arch over the flat lintel has joggled voussoirs. The gate is in a pishtaq higher than the rest of the perimeter wall and is crowned with decorative crenellations. The crenellations and the muqarnas are of a different design than those on the mausoleum. The sabil window in the northern corner of the enclosure is blocked with bricks and cement.

To mask the damage, the lower parts of the walls have been covered by modern facing of small limestone tiles, which itself is powdering now. The cracks in the southern corner of the entrance façade and in the lintel over the window in the south-western façade indicate differential settlement of the foundations. Otherwise the unit is in fair condition.","Previously, the enclosure used to be a walled complex connecting al-Baqli family enclosure with al-Sanhawi enclosure sharing a courtyard, before the family separated the complex, turning it into an independent unit.","06_DSC_4903s.JPG","DSC_4903s.JPG","18 August 2022","Hadeer Ahmad","Fair","before AH 1304 / AD 1887","06_4913ss.jpg","Not dated by dedicatory inscription"
