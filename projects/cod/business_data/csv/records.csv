•	Small blue convex insets of glazed ceramic that decorate the dome"," Mustafa al-Babi al-Halabi’s funerary enclosure is one of the largest and best maintained in the area under study. More than two-thirds of the rectangular plot is taken up by an open funerary enclosure arranged as a garden, while the section facing the Sultan Ahmad Street is a Neo-Mamluk building. The domed mausoleum is placed in the southern corner of the enclosure. The cubical block of the mausoleum is taller than the adjacent facades and topped with an elaborate fleur-de-lys crenellation resembling those of late Mamluk period in the reign of Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri. The dome sits on a tall octagonal drum with no zone-of-transition visible from the outside, featuring double round-arch windows topped by an oculus in each of the eight sides, with knotted mouldings framing and floral “arabesque” motifs in the spandrels. The dome constructed of reinforced concrete is decorated with fleur-de-lys floral pattern in prefabricated plaster panels. The pattern is virtually identical with this on the dome of Amir Azrumuk (monument No. 87, AD 1504-5) (Index, s.v.), located about one kilometre to the south in the same area of the cemetery. The small blue convex insets of glazed ceramic decorating the dome are also present in the tomb of Azrumuk. (Williams, p. 279-80). The main façade adjacent to the mausoleum is tripartite, with two bays each featuring a single window flanking the central, slightly projecting part with the main entrance portal. The right (north) bay is slightly wider and protruding forwards compared to the left one. The entrance section is asymmetrical, with the entrance door set to the right of its axis, and a single engaged corner column to the left. The rectangular entrance door is set in a rectangular recess topped with a three-tiered muqarnas frieze. Above the door is a recessed long inscription panel with one line of text. The windows of the façade are identical with those of the mausoleum. They are rectangular, fitted with iron grilles, with marble lintels decorated with recessed panels, over which are segmental relieving arches with joggled voussoirs and set in a rectangular recess topped by a two-tiered muqarnas frieze with muqarnases grouped in pairs, a feature of many Mamluk-period buildings including the tomb of Amir Azrumuk. The section adjacent to the mausoleum in the side (south) elevation is identical with the corresponding bay of the front façade, while the rest of the enclosure is surrounded by a lower simple wall of rough stone._x000d_
The entrance gate leads to a vestibule open to the sky, which on the back end opens to the garden with an arcade of three pointed arches on round columns with simple Mamluk-style capitals. A similar arcade of three arches faces the vestibule to the left, forming a portico in front of the mausoleum and the reception room that precedes it. To the right (north) of the vestibule, is a residential zone composed of two rooms and a toilet.","(In all descriptions, the direction towards Mecca is called eastern, and other directions are named accordingly) The structure is in a generally good condition, and well-maintained. However, much of the decoration of the dome is missing, leaving exposed the concrete structure.","Mustafa Al-Babi Al-Halabi was the owner of the printing press and publishing house which were among the earliest and most important in Cairo. His Syrian uncle Ahmad Al-Halabi originating from Albab village in the Aleppo region was a businessman who immigrated to Egypt and established the ""Maymaniyah Press"" in 1859 which later became ""Al-Babi Al-Halabi Press"". Ahmad was infertile so he brought his nephews from Aleppo to carry on the business. The business later split into two entities, where Eissa Al-Halabi established the House of Revival of Arabic Books ""دار إحياء الكتب العربية"", while Mustafa Al-Halabi, the owner of this funerary enclosure, established the ""Mustafa Al-Babi Al-Halabi and Sons Library and Printing Company"". The printing house was mainly concerned with publishing avant-garde Islamic studies books like ""Al-Tabari and Al-Ghazali"". The print house still exists and is run by his descendants, located in al-Darrasa a few hundred meters away from the funerary enclosure and is also close to Al-Halabi Square, which might be named after him. _x000d_

The broader northern part is a well-maintained garden including only one new brick cenotaph. The narrower southern section contains: a domed burial chamber in the south-western corner, rectangular and protruding into the garden beyond the wall dividing the enclosure; a residential unit in the south-eastern corne of the enclosure; and another residential unit in the middle, with narow courtyards to the sides and a passage between it and the southern perimeter wall._x000d_
The enclosure has two entrances: the in the nothern perimeter wall is a simply decorated wrought-iron gate leading to the garden section of the enclosure. The entrance on the eastern side leads from the Sultan Ahmad Street to the building with the street façade that features an asymmetrically placed wide gate covered with a segmental arch, simply decorated with Mamluk-inspired knotted moldings, over which a marble panel with a single line of inscription is placed. There is a single window to the left of the gate and two on the right, all rectangular and with Mamluk-inspired knotted moulding framing around the lintels with segmental relieving arches above them. The building includes a reception space and two guest rooms with a small toilet and kitchen. This space is currently used as residential house for the doorman._x000d_
Another free-standing simple structure in the middle of the southern section of the enclosure was also used as a residential space for the visitors but was inaccessible at the time of recording. The third concrete-and-brick structure is the burial chamber located in the north-western corner of the enclosure. It is a one-story building with a large concrete dome in the middle, wider than the walled-off southern part of the enclosure, i.e., protruding into the garden. The facades of the burial chamber and the wall dividing the enclosure are decorated with simple Mamluk-inspired knotted moulding and are topped with rather complex fleur-de-lys crenellations prefabricated as reinforced concrete slabs. The huge rectangular windows of the burial chamber are in the easten and northern façades grouped in pairs within shallow rectangular recesses topped with simple muqarnases, while these in the western and southern façades are much smaller, placed in pairs and covered with pointed arches. The rectangular entrance door of the mausoleum in the middle of the eastern façade is placed in a shallow pointed-arched recess in the entrance section of the elevation which is taller than the rest of the wall, forming a pishtaq (Petersen, p.234). All facades have recently been covered with thick textured cement plaster that obscures the details of decoration. It is applied over the original, much finer plaster, which was painted in red and beige-yellow stripes imitationg ablaq masonry (Petersen, p.1-2.) The burial chamber is a large space divided into three internal sections by wide, flat elliptical arches resting on squat Islamic-style columns standing by the walls on high pedestals. The central space in the center is covered a dome on an octogonal drum that incorporates a muqarnas zone-of-transition and is supported by pointed-arched squinches in the corners. The single marble cenotaph placed under the dome is unusual in featuring open books sculpted in marble on its both ends. The central space is separated by wooden mashrabiya screens from the side chambers that are used as reception spaces and contain finely decorated Islamic-style wooden furniture. There is a dado of multicolour terrazzo around the walls of the burial chamber, and above it, a band of intricate Islamic arabesque floral pattern. The interior of the dome, its drum and base, decorative panels over the windows, and the ceilings of the side chambers and muqarnas friezes under on top of the walls are very richly decorated with colourful painted Islamic geometric and floral patterns and calligraphic inscriptions panels.","The buildings and the garden are well maintained. However, some of the crenellations in the internal separating wall between the buildings and the garden are broken or missing. The external walls, originally painted in two-tone imitation of ablaq masonry, have recently been covered with a layer of brownish gray textured cement plaster that obscures architectural decoration.","Tal‘at Harb (25 November 1867 – 13 August 1941) was a leading Egyptian entrepreneur and founder of Banque Misr, and its group of companies, in May 1920. (Wucher King, p.193-4). The establishment of Banque Misr, the first real Egyptian bank owned by Egyptian shareholders and staffed by Egyptian nationals, where Arabic (the national language) was used in all communications, was a major step in establishing a national economic identity. The idea of establishing Banque Misr first emerged in 1907, when Tal‘at Harb contributed 100 EGP to the establishment of al-Ahly Sporting Club. He was a renowned nationalist industrialist; he published books calling for the founding of a national bank with Egyptian financing.

•	The long gateway with the sequence of three elaborately decorated gates _x000d_
•	A huge alabaster bathtub randomly thrown in the garden","The largest and most decorated funerary enclosure documented in this research is a one-story stone-built walled enclosure, with the main entrance in the formally designed elaborate eastern façade. The façade is articulated with engaged columns in two tiers, without an inter-story cornice. The main gate is flanked by two massive buttresses with engaged corner columns topped with Islamic-style geometric capitals in the lower story and panels of geometric pattern above, which --like the gate itself-- are framed in knotted mouldings. The gateway section is taller than the rest of the façade, topped with elaborate fleur-de-lys crenelations, and is the only section of the façade clearly based on Islamic architectural tradition. On both ends of the façade are flat projections framed with triple engaged columns, each with a tall pointed-arch window and a small rectangular marble-framed window above. The sections of the façade between the gateway and the side projections are each divided into three bays by engaged columns: round and with composite order capitals in the lower tier and semi-octagonal with simple geometric capitals in the upper tier. Each bay has a large rectangular window in the lower level with a marble lintel and a segmental relieving arch above it, over which is placed a smaller oval window in marble framing, those in the central bays having the oval window within a rectangular marble frame. (The façade therefore gives the impression of a double-storied building, while in fact behind it are single full-height halls.) _x000d_
The round-arched main entrance leads into a long passage divided into two chambers by a gate in the middle, which is pointed-arched and fitted with extremely elaborate double-leaved wooden coffered door in Gothic Revival style, with an iron openwork in the arch over the lintel in Gothic tracery motifs. To the right side of the gateway is a huge hall with a mihrab in its shorter wall, originally divided into three aisles perpendicular to the main façade (and not related to its architectural divisions) by two rows of four columns each. The capitals are in Islamic style, decorated with muqarnases. The southern row of columns has largely collapsed, and the roof is missing. The hall is accessible from the first vestibule through a huge arched doorway flanked by two smaller doors, and also from the second vestibule through an arched gate placed in the middle of a façade with huge rectangular windows in two tiers._x000d_
To the left of the gateway is a large room along the main façade, now used for storage purposes, and behind it, a set of smaller rooms, now much altered. The northern internal elevation of the first vestibule is decorated with stone medallions including the initials of Khedive Isma‘il (K.I.), the right one being a mirror image._x000d_
In the southern lateral façade, the windows (of the huge three-aisled hall) are placed high and are double arched windows divided by piers with engaged colonettes and topped by an oculus in a fashion reminiscent of Mamluk fenestration. The windows of the northern lateral façade are huge, rectangular, placed low and fitted with iron grilles._x000d_
The third gate leads from the second vestibule to a huge garden, currently including four free-standing residential buildings Three of them are constructed of red bricks, while the fourth imitates in stone the features of the enclosure’s façade. A luxurious ornate bathtub of a huge monolithic piece of alabaster, apparently dating back to Khedive Isma‘il’s era is randomly thrown in the garden.","The general structural condition of the enclosure is poor_x000d_
The roof of the huge prayer hall south of the gateway chamber has fallen, as has much of the southern row of columns in the hall.","Ibrahim Pasha, son of the ruler of Egypt and founder of the dynasty Muhammad ‘Ali Pasha built a palace known under the name The High Palace in 1820 in what is now known as Garden City. It hosted the first meeting of the Egyptian advisory council “Majlis al-Mashoura” on 2 December 1829. After ‘Abbas Hilmi I assumed power, he donated the High Palace and its appurtenances in 1848 to Isma'il Bey, later Khedive Isma'il, who later sold the palace to his mother Hoshiyar Hanim Qadin in 1863. Khedive Isma'il’s remodelling of the palace is evidenced by his initials (K.I. - Khedive Isma'il) carved in stone in the gateway, still existing on the current remnants located in the Desert of the Mamluks. Hoshiyar Hanim Qadin took good care of the building until it was returned to the Egyptian Government in 1880. It was subsequently sold in 1898 to “al-Dayra al-Sunnya”, who sold it finally to the real estate company Charles Bacchus. The company demolished the palace in 1906 and sold its ruins, luxurious furniture, precious antiques, and rare garden trees (Negm, 2002). One of the façades of the High Palace was purchased by Sheikh ‘Ali al-Waqad and rebuilt in the Desert of the Mamluks. (El Kadi and Bonnamy, 2007, the date 1870 in this publication is certainly mistaken.) Two photographs in the collection of the Musée Nicéphore Niépce in Chalon sur Saône in France show the street façade of the High Palace before the transfer, clearly showing architectural elements now in the façade of the al-Waqqad family funerary enclosure. It is evident, however, that after the transfer, these elements were put in a different order in a differently designed façade. The present façade is straight, while in the original one, the entrance gate was placed in a deep recess. Moreover, what used to be an external gate on a street is now a gate between the first and second open vestibules. The photographs with numbers MNN 96.33.222 and MNN 96.33.223 are available in the Museum’s online collection : https://www.open-museeniepce.com/accueil _x000d_

Sheikh ‘Ali al-Waqqad was a pioneer of the bamboo industry in Egypt. He opened a factory on Queen Nazli Street (currently Ramses), where French labourers processed bamboo imported from India. After a dispute over wages in 1920 the French workers left and the factory was threatened with closure. However, the sheikh insisted on continuing the operation of the factory and entrusted the task to his son Muhammad. He trained Egyptian workers who replaced the French, and that area in Ramses Street is still famous for the bamboo industry, with the most important businesses owned by the descendants of students of Muhammad ‘Ali al-Waqqad (Ahmad al-Waqad, 2018)._x000d_
It appears that the façade and gateway that were transferred to the Desert of the Mamluks by al-Waqad family date to the times of Khedive Isma’il, judging from the style of their architecture. It uses Gothic Revival forms in a rather generic way, similar to other early Orientalist buildings in Cairo, such as the Gezira Palace (1869), and not the neo-Mamluk forms that were used after the work of the Comite de Conservation des Monuments de l’Art Arabe from 1882 on made the Mamluk architecture better known, resulting in such works as the al-Rifa’i Mosque (completed 1905, designed by Max Herz)._x000d_
The date 1292 in the grille in the arch of the main gate translates to AD 1875. At that time, Khedive Isma‘il was in a precarious financial condition, and burdened with enormous debt, which forced him to sell in that year his shares in the Suez Canal for a fraction of their value (Thompson, p.248). The date is therefore unlikely to be of original construction. This is also suggested by the very crude execution of the plaque with the date, incompatible with the details of other metalwork in the building.","•	Grand, Pierre Bey, Plan général de la Ville du Caire, available online in the American University in Cairo’s Rare Books and Special Collections Digital Library_x000d_

The northern and eastern elevations are plain, covered with a simple classical-style corniche, and plastered. The north elevation is divided into bays with vertical stripes of ashlar stone masonry. Huge rectangular windows are plain, and the gate in the middle of the east façade has very simple architectural framing with no neo-Mamluk elements.

The entrance gate section is taller than the rest of the façade, forming a pishtaq (Petersen, p.234). The rectangular entrance door with knotted moulding framing similar to these over the windows is set in a wide recess covered with very elaborate muqarnas hood of five tiers of “stalactite” muqarnas niches. Two gals seats flank the doorway to the sides of its recess in a typically Mamluk manner (Amin & Ibrahim, p. 30). The decorated door-leaves feature neo-classical, not neo-Mamluk motifs.

wider recess with a pair of narrow windows, while at the northern end is a sabil placed in a chamfered corner, with a central window fitted with a marble ledge and two side windows._x000d_
The two gateways are on the main axis opposite each other and lead to the central courtyard. There are two residential flats on either side of the main entrance on the western side, two rooms on either side of the secondary entrance, and two burial chambers extending at the southern and the northern sides, all overlooking an enclosed courtyard with a garden layout. _x000d_
The burial chamber on the southern side contains two limestone cenotaphs and three decorative marble cenotaphs. The other chamber is on the northern side and contains five decorative marble cenotaphs, one simple marble cenotaph, and one wooden cenotaph.","The enclosure is in a good condition but lower parts of the walls are seriously damaged by moisture. The roof has recently been repaired and new drainage pipes installed. The relieving arches over doors and windows in the stone sections of the façade have recently been crudely filled in with mortar, which suggests that decorative ceramic tiles were recently stolen from them.","A small, apparently modern inscription plaque by the main entrance door gives the name of Mahmud Fahmi al-Nuqrashi Pasha, the Prime Minister. _x000d_
Mahmud al-Nuqrashi was an Egyptian politician. After resigning in 1937 from the Wafd party then lead by Mustafa Nahas (whose likely heir he was considered), al-Nuqrashi founded with Ahmad Mahir in January 1938 the S‘adist Party which claimed to be the true heirs to Wafd’s founder S‘ad Zaghlul. Mahmud al-Nuqrashi held various ministerial posts in the 1930s and 40s, served as Prime Minister from February 1945 for one year, and then again from December 1946 until his death. On 8 December 1948 he outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood he was assassinated by its member Twenty days later. (Wucher King, p.491-2; Vatikiotis, p.364-7)._x000d_
The date AH 1305 on a cenotaph inside corresponds to AD 1888. This seems too early for the front façade designed in historically accurate neo-Mamluk style, but does not seem improbable for the back and side facades and the back gateway. It is not impossible that the front façade is a later remodelling._x000d_

In the centre of the eastern façade of the perimeter wall is a more elaborate neo-Mamluk gate set in a shallow rectangular recess topped with a three-tiered muqarnas and framed in knotted mouldings. The relieving arch over the flat lintel has joggled voussoirs. The gate is in a pishtaq higher than the rest of the perimeter wall and is crowned with decorative crenellations. Both the crenellations and the muqarnas are of a different design than those on the mausoleum. The sabil window in the north-western corner of the enclosure is blocked with bricks and cement. The sabil is inaccessible due to massive plant overgrowth in this part of the enclosure._x000d_
The cubical mausoleum has facades of ashlar stone masonry crowned with decorative crenellations of elaborate form emulating late Circassan Mamluk period and engaged columns in the corners. The side and façades each have a single rectangular window with a flat arch forming the lintel and a segmental relieving arch above it, and over it a small round window. The windows are placed in wide shallow recesses topped with simple two-tiered small muqarnases. In the entrance façades, the doors have identical arrangement of the lintel and an oculus above as the windows in other facades, but it is not placed in a recess and is flanked by two narrow recesses without muqarnas tops. The wooden door and the window have a simple decoration of mafruqa panels._x000d_
Inside, there are three elaborately carved marble cenotaphs bearing the names of Ahmad Khairi Pasha’s wives, two simpler, newer marble cenotaphs, and a modern brick-built cenotaph. The door and windows lintels are framed in knotted mouldings, and above each is a round qamariya gypsum grille with a vase of flowers surrounded by an inscription. The ceiling has a central skylight and is painted in simple Ottoman Baroque-style motifs around the edges of the ceiling compartments with similar motifs in the centre.","The bottom parts of the wall are seriously affected by rising damp, with the stones powdering. To mask the damage, the lower parts of the walls have been covered by modern facing of small limestone tiles, which itself is powdering now. The cracks in the southern corner of the entrance façade and in the lintel over the window in the south-western façade indicate differential settlement of the foundations. Otherwise, the unit is in fair condition.","Previously, the enclosure used to be a walled complex comprising al-Baqli family enclosure and al-Sanhawi enclosure sharing a courtyard, before the family separated the complex, turning it into an independent unit.

Below, two diamond-positioned square inscriptions to the sides contain the shahada. The door and windows are fitted with wrought-iron grilles with decoration of simple Art Noveau-inspired design. In the relieving arches over the openings are painted glazed ceramic tiles. They do not form regular patterns, but are randomly placed fragmentary pieces of an Ottoman-style wall decoration. This may either result from the tiles being genuine Ottoman-period Iznik or Kütahia tiles (or their Syrian imitations), or else from the designer’s desire to create such an impression. Behind the front façade is an open loggia with concrete roof supported on two square stone pillars with chamfered corners. The side (southern) elevation is much lower than the building on the front side, with a stepped transitional section.

The northern courtyard is slightly irregular and measures approximately 21 x 23 -25 metres, with the south-eastern corner taken away by a neighbouring funerary enclosure; the southern one measures approximately 8.5 x 16 metres. They share a long continuous long western wall. The northern courtyard is accessed through simple stone gates in the western and northern walls, topped with semi-circular arches. By the eastern wall are three single-storied service / residential rooms. In the north-western corner is a huge rectangular hall with undecorated interior, furnished with huge elaborate wooden benches/sofas for gatherings of visitors. In the south-western corner is a square burial chamber. Its northern and eastern façades are tripartite, with a door in the muddle flanked by two windows, all covered with steeply pointed arches. The three arches are framed together in simple and ungainly knotted moulding in plastered. The mausoleum is topped with a simple moulding and fleur-de-lys crenellations cast in plaster of cement. Otherwise, the walls of all the rooms in the courtyard are devoid of decoration.  The mausoleum window shutters and door leaves are panelled, with simple mafruka patterns. The window panes over the arches have coloured glazing in decorative, mafruka-based simple divisions. The window sashes also have simple decorative divisions. The roof of the burial chamber rests on four wooden columns on tall pedestals and of very simple Tuscan capitals. The columns carry simple brackets supporting beams that carry a wooden structure of a dome drum. (There is no zone-of-transition, so technically speaking, the structure is a roof lantern rather than a dome.) The drum is twelve-sided, pierced with six windows with coloured glazing in panels of simple mafruka-based patterns. On the polygonal drum sits a round dome, which results in awkward overhangs both inside and outside. The exterior of the dome is ribbed._x000d_
Between the columns are placed elaborate wooden screens featuring turned-wood mashrabiya panels and mother-of-pearl inlays that form an enclosure (Ar: “maqsura”) around the wooden cenotaph of Shaykh Hasuna, which is covered with a cloth bearing elaborate calligraphic inscriptions._x000d_
Above the northern door of the mausoleum is a half of very badly damaged stucco [?] inscription panel including the name Shaykh … Hasuna al-Nawawi and date 22 [?] Shawwal AH 1343 [corresponding to 15 May AD 1925.]_x000d_
The northern section of the courtyard (between the rooms in north-western and north-eastern corners) is screened off with a large panelled wooden screen with horseshoe arched openings in the upper part._x000d_
_x000d_
The smaller southern courtyard is an open enclosure, with no rooms within. Its southern wall is composed of four stone pillars, between which are short sections of picket fence and two openwork iron gates of slightly different widths._x000d_
In the northern wall is the simple rectangular door to the northern courtyard, and a wide low window of the burial chamber, fitted with w wrought-iron grille of simple, Art Nouveau-inspired pattern. By the western and northern walls stand five rather simple carved marble cenotaphs, the most recent bearing the date AD 1976, the most elaborately decorated one dated to AH 1371 [corresponding to AD 1952.] On the latter cenotaph is an inscription in raised relief that was evidently added at a later date, referring to ‘Abd al-Khaliq Hasuna and giving the date 1992.","The unit is in overall fair condition and maintained. It has recently been renovated, with new coats of paint to the walls, repairs to walls damaged by rising damp, and repairs to and repainting of some woodwork. The relatively recent cenotaphs in the southern part of the southern courtyard have been damaged by rising damp, and were recently rather unprofessionally repaired.","Shaykh Hasuna al-Nawawi (1839 – 1925, buried in the mausoleum in the northern courtyard) was twice the Saykh of al-Azhar in 1895 – 99 and 1907 – 1910, member of the Supreme Council of the Shariya Court in 1895, and the Grand Mufti of Egypt in 1895 – 1899. He strove to improve educational standards at al-Azhar and to introduce modern sciences (Street Story website). _x000d_
Muhammad ‘Abd al-Khaliq Hasuna (1898 – 1992, buried in the southern courtyard) was an Egyptian diplomat and statesman. He held the positions of the Director of the Foreign Office from 1932 to 1934; Director of Political and Business Affairs from 1934 to 1938; Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1938 to 1940; The first Undersecretary of the Ministry of Social Affairs from 1940 to 1942; Governor of Alexandria from 1942 to 1948; Ambassador and Undersecretary of State from 1948 to 1949; Minister of Social Affairs from 1949 to 1950; Minister of Education in 1952; and Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1952.

There is a main single-storey L-shaped building by the main and about half of the northern facades, and a subsidiary single-storey building in the south-western corner of the enclosure. The rest of the lot is an open courtyard planted with trees, with simple wooden verandas (now much dilapidated) by the southern and western facades of the main building and the eastern façade of the subsidiary building. External and courtyard façades of the complex are all in a highly simplified, Classically-inspired style, without any neo-Mamluk or otherwise Islamic elements. In the axially arranged entrance façade, a centrally placed entrance gate is topped with a boldly rusticated semi-circular arch, with decoratively panelled wooden door and a simple decorative wrought iron grille in the arch above. There are two huge plain rectangular windows to the left (north) right (south) sides of the gate, all fitted with simple, plain louvre shutters and simple decorative wrought iron grilles. The north-eastern corner is rounded, with a huge, plain rectangular sabil window with simple panelled shutters and a simple decorative wrought iron grille. There is a simple rectangular recess over the sabil window, evidently intended for an inscription panel, but now empty. A secondary gate in the southern façade leads directly to the courtyard. The corners of the enclosure, framings of the gates, and the cornice are bult of ashlar stone, the rest of the walls are constructed of rough stone, those of the western part of the enclosure left unplastered. The front façade and eastern parts of the north and south facades are topper with simple classical cornice._x000d_
The entrance door leads to a huge hallway leading to the courtyard, with doors leading to two burial chambers on either side, in the two wings of the building that also include residential and service rooms. _x000d_
The southern burial chamber is a plain undecorated room covered with a ceiling with exposed wooden roofing beams resting on doubled steel C-beams, which are supported by two simple wooden posts.

The interior decoration of the northern burial chamber belies the austerity of the external look of the building. It is divided into three sections, the side sections extending further to the west than the square central one. The southern section, accessed from the hallway to its south, is a vestibule separated from the rest of the burial chamber with a tall, very elaborate wooden screen of turned-wood mashrabiya panels and openwork patterns, with a double-leaf door in its left (western)part leading to the central section of the chamber. In the southern section stand two simple marble cenotaphs dated to the 1930s.The wooden ceiling has exposed chamfered and moulded beams and is painted in colourful geometric patterns. The window in the eastern wall, as well as windows of the eastern and western walls of the central section are fitted with internal wooden shutters of mashrabiya panels and wooden frames decorated with knotted mouldings. _x000d_
The square central section is covered with an extremely elaborate wooden ceiling divided into rectangular panels and bands separating them filled with nailed-on lath forming complex Islamic geometric patterns, colourfully painted. Over the middle square is an octagonal lantern with windows filled with qamariyat grilles and the octagonal ceiling resting on a wooden muqarnas frieze. In the western part of the central hall stands an elaborately carved marble cenotaph dated 1336 / 1918. Between the central and the side sections stand two wooden pillars that carry elaborate corbels carrying transverse beams and separating the sections of the burial chamber; the corbels (termed “kurdi”) and the beams are richly painted in arabesque patterns. _x000d_
The northern section has a wooden ceiling with colourful geometric pattern painted on its flat underside boarding. A structural beam of double steel C-beams close to the central section has decorative corbels of mashrabiya panels. The lower parts of the walls are covered with wooden boarding with painted in imitation of niches with colonnettes. The windows in the northern section have elaborate internal shutters of mashrabiya panels and a mashrabiya cornice, and a door in the western wall has a similar frame and cornice, and door-leaves painted in geometric pattens. The north-eastern corner of this section is rounded and includes the sabil window. In the northern section of the burial chamber stands a simple marble cenotaph with no shahid stelae, with calligraphic panels in fine script it raised relief, signed by the calligrapher.","The larger cenotaph in the southern burial chamber bears the name of Lady Shafiqa Hanim, the daughter of the late Amin Pasha Fikri who died in the afternoon of the first day of Dhu al-Higga 1330 AH [= 10 November AD 1912].

Another rectangular single-storey building stands by the southern wall, forming a front courtyard in the south-eastern corner of the enclosure. The main portal and adjoining parts of the façade, the secondary gate in the northern façade, the base course and the cornice are built of ashlar stone. The rest of the walls are built of rough stone, divided into sections by ashlar stone pillars. There is no evidence that the rough stone sections were ever plastered, although the building does not appear to be unfinished._x000d_
In the front façade, the main portal is asymmetrically placed closer to the northern end, and forms a pishtaq twice the height of the rest of the walls, topped with huge fleur-de-lys crenellations. The entrance is placed in a recess topped with a trefoil hood with a fluted semi-dome in the upper part resting on a very elaborate muqarnas frieze with “stalactite” muqarnases. The recess is framed in knotted mouldings. The composition follows very closely the forms of Mamluk-period architecture in Cairo. The rectangular entrance door has its lintel, which is a flat arch of limestone blocks, and a segmental relieving arch above it framed in knotted mouldings. Over the door is a rectangular recess in moulded frame, evidently intended for an inscription panel, but now empty. There are two narrow undecorated windows with flat-arch lintels flanking the portal, and two large, plain rectangular windows in the right (northern) section of the façade. The wider left section of the façade (now ruined) that formed the wall of the south-eastern courtyard apparently was blank, with no windows.

The complex is divided into a huge rectangular courtyard taking the western part of the enclosure and a narrower eastern section.  The eastern section consists of (1) the northern courtyard accessed through a gate in its eastern wall, with a small single-storey service building in the north-eastern corner; (2) the southern courtyard, also accessed through a gate in its eastern wall, and with a tract of rooms by its southern side that includes a round-fronted sabil in the south-eastern corner of the enclosure. The courtyards are separated by a building that was apparently originally accessed from either of them._x000d_
The western courtyard is accessible through the gates in the western walls of courtyards (1) and (2), and originally also directly through two gates in its southern and northern walls (now walled up.) The western courtyard contains (3) a free-standing mausoleum; (4) a service building by the southern wall; (5) an open burial area in the north-western corner of the enclosure._x000d_
(1) The northern courtyard is separated from the street with a picket fence of wrought iron with simple decorative patterns, with a two-leaved wrought iron gate between two square pillars of stonemasonry with prominent cornices on muqarnas corbels with two merlons of elaborate fleur-de-lys crenellation on each side, with bulbous ornaments on top (which amounts to a rather top-heavy design.) The single-storey service building in the north-eastern corner is simple and undecorated, with the entrance in the southern wall and a single plain window in the northern and eastern walls. The western side of the courtyard is a low wall with a balustrade of classical (not Islamic) balusters (the wall was recently heightened over the balustrade.) A gate of two wrought iron and sheet metal leaves placed between pillars similar to those in the front gate (but with lighter crenellations) leads to the western courtyard._x000d_
The southern side of the courtyard is the northern wall of the single-storey building standing between the southern and northern courtyards. The simple, undecorated symmetrical façade features an entrance porch elevated about one metre above the courtyard level, with rectangular openings to the sides and two rectangular openings flanking an arched one at the front (in an extremely simplified version of a Venetian window arrangement.) On the sides of the porch are mounted two hanging lamps on elaborate Art Nouveau wrought iron brackets. There is a simple rectangular window in the façade on each side of the porch. Apparently, the building was topped with a simple cornice, which has now mostly been removed, except from the street-facing façade, which is plain and simple, with two rectangular windows._x000d_
(2) The southern courtyard was designed as essentially symmetrical to the northern one, with the difference that the whole southern side is taken by a tract of rooms, and the gate in back (western) side leading to the western courtyard is covered with a segmental arch, flanked by simplified pilasters, and topped with crenellations. The entrance porch of the building to the north has been walled up, and modern nondescript shacks built against it. The sabil in the south-eastern corner of the enclosure is a round-fronted structure with three rectangular sabil windows fitted with iron grilles, set between two short side wings with another sabil window in each. Above, there is an upper tier of pointed-arch windows. However, there is no upper storey, so the upper windows are opening in a tall parapet. The windows of the sabil are framed in knotted mouldings and set in shallow recesses that taper in steps towards the top and are covered with muqarnas friezes in the round part, and with simple pointed horseshoe arches in the straight sections. The walls of the sabil are crowned with elaborate fleur-de-lys muqarnases._x000d_
(3) The mausoleum is square in plan, and positioned at an angle to the perimeter walls and other buildings in the complex to conform to the direction towards Mecca. This is surprising, considering that the Mecca-facing wall is the entrance façade, with the door where a prayer niche would typically be placed. The design of the mausoleum is strictly axially symmetrical. The entrance portal forms a pishtaq much taller than the other façades. The entrance is placed in a recess topped with a trefoil hood with a pointed semi-dome in the upper part (in which the word “Allah” is boldly painted) resting on a very elaborate muqarnas frieze with “stalactite” muqarnases. The composition follows closely the forms of Mamluk-period architecture in Cairo. Over the entrance recess is a panel with a very elaborate calligraphic dedicatory inscription that includes the date 1338 AH [= AD 1920]. The recess and the inscription panel are framed in knotted mouldings. Over the entrance door (which could not be accessed for description) is a pointed-arch window framed in knotted mouldings. The entrance section is crowned with an elaborate muqarnas frieze._x000d_
The windows of the mausoleum are placed in shallow rectangular recesses topped with muqarnas friezes and are placed in two tiers; the lower ones are rectangular, with relieving arches of joggled voussoirs, and the upper ones are twinned and covered with semi-circular arches with an oculus above in a one-over-two arrangement. The lintels, relieving arches above them and lower parts of the upper tier windows are framed in knotted mouldings in the front façade (but not in the side and back façades.) There are two window recesses in each façade, with the entrance portal between them in the eastern façade, and with blank walls in the other façades. In the corners of the mausoleum are engaged columns with muqarnas capitals. Over the middle of the mausoleum chamber is a tall roof lantern, square in plan and covered with a flat slab. Its four walls are pierced with plain triple windows covered with semi-circular arches with oculi above in a one-over-two-over-three arrangement. The windows are placed in flat recesses topped with muqarnas friezes at the top of the walls. The mausoleum walls, its lantern, the western gate in the southern courtyard, and the pillars of the two gates in the eastern façade of the enclosure are topped with large crenellations of complex fleur-de-lys based forms reminiscent of the late-Mamluk forms typical of the reign of Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri (reigned 1501 – 1516.)_x000d_
(4) The building in the south-eastern corner of the western courtyard is simple, with the northern façade identical with this of the building between the eastern-side courtyards, i.e., with an entrance porch, and three simple large windows in the southern façade facing the street._x000d_
(5) In the open rectangular burial area in the north-western corner of the western courtyard stand three tomb markers (inaccessible for closer inspection)._x000d_
The mausoleum, the sabil, gates, corners of the enclosure, etc. are built of ashlar stone, other walls are constructed of rough stone and plastered. The northern and southern gates of the enclosure (now walled up) were taller than the adjoining walls and arched.","The complex is in good condition and continuously maintained. The lower parts of the walls, especially in the sabil, are damaged by rising damp.","Omar Makram was the Naqib al-Ashraf, or the leader of those who claim descent from the Prophet Muhammad, during the French occupation of Egypt in 1798-1801. He was the leader of poplar opposition to the occupation, and after the French withdrawal was instrumental in promoting the installation of Muhammad ‘Ali as the viceroy of Egypt, although their relationship later deteriorated. He has been widely perceived as the precursor by Egyptian nationalists (Wucher King, 415-16, Vatikiotis, p.39, 51). He died in 1811 and is buried in the Eastern Cemetery just over a kilometre to the south of the family enclosure; his tomb has recently (around 2020) been registered as a national monument, based on the historical importance of the deceased, not on architectural merit. It is not known why the family did not transfer his body to the sumptuous mausoleum._x000d_

In the window is a very simple decorative grille welded from pieces if rolled iron. Above the window is a roundel with a Qur’anic inscription carved into the surface of the wall. It imitates the form of the blazons with royal titles (rank) that were used on buildings founded by Mamluk sultans (examples abound in the neighbourhood.) Over the roundel is an inscription panel that includes the date AH 1312. Another inscription carved over the entrance door includes the name Muhammad Khairallah and the date AH 1321. The portal and the sabil door are the only elements of the building in neo-Mamluk style. They follow the mediaeval Mamluk patterns quite closely, while the quality of craftsmanship is good, but not outstanding, and overall, the unit is a modest one. _x000d_
There is a plain rectangular window with a simple, non-decorative iron grille and simple panelled shutters to the right (west) of the portal, and two more such windows in the plain western façade, which is undecorated save a simple cornice.
