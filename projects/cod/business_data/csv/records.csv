•	Small blue convex insets of glazed ceramic that decorate the dome"," Mustafa al-Babi al-Halabi’s funerary enclosure is one of the largest and best maintained in the area under study. More than two-thirds of the rectangular plot is taken up by an open funerary enclosure arranged as a garden, while the section facing the Sultan Ahmad Street is a Neo-Mamluk building. The domed mausoleum is placed in the southern corner of the enclosure. The cubical block of the mausoleum is taller than the adjacent facades and topped with an elaborate fleur-de-lys crenellation resembling those of late Mamluk period in the reign of Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri. The dome sits on a tall octagonal drum with no zone-of-transition visible from the outside, featuring double round-arch windows topped by an oculus in each of the eight sides, with knotted mouldings framing and floral “arabesque” motifs in the spandrels. The dome constructed of reinforced concrete is decorated with fleur-de-lys floral pattern in prefabricated plaster panels. The pattern is virtually identical with this on the dome of Amir Azrumuk (monument No. 87, AD 1504-5) (Index, s.v.), located about one kilometre to the south in the same area of the cemetery. The small blue convex insets of glazed ceramic decorating the dome are also present in the tomb of Azrumuk. (Williams, p. 279-80). The main façade adjacent to the mausoleum is tripartite, with two bays each featuring a single window flanking the central, slightly projecting part with the main entrance portal. The right (north) bay is slightly wider and protruding forwards compared to the left one. The entrance section is asymmetrical, with the entrance door set to the right of its axis, and a single engaged corner column to the left. The rectangular entrance door is set in a rectangular recess topped with a three-tiered muqarnas frieze. Above the door is a recessed long inscription panel with one line of text. The windows of the façade are identical with those of the mausoleum. They are rectangular, fitted with iron grilles, with marble lintels decorated with recessed panels, over which are segmental relieving arches with joggled voussoirs and set in a rectangular recess topped by a two-tiered muqarnas frieze with muqarnases grouped in pairs, a feature of many Mamluk-period buildings including the tomb of Amir Azrumuk. The section adjacent to the mausoleum in the side (south) elevation is identical with the corresponding bay of the front façade, while the rest of the enclosure is surrounded by a lower simple wall of rough stone._x000d_
The entrance gate leads to a vestibule open to the sky, which on the back end opens to the garden with an arcade of three pointed arches on round columns with simple Mamluk-style capitals. A similar arcade of three arches faces the vestibule to the left, forming a portico in front of the mausoleum and the reception room that precedes it. To the right (north) of the vestibule, is a residential zone composed of two rooms and a toilet.","(In all descriptions, the direction towards Mecca is called eastern, and other directions are named accordingly) The structure is in a generally good condition, and well-maintained. However, much of the decoration of the dome is missing, leaving exposed the concrete structure.","Mustafa Al-Babi Al-Halabi was the owner of the printing press and publishing house which were among the earliest and most important in Cairo. His Syrian uncle Ahmad Al-Halabi originating from Albab village in the Aleppo region was a businessman who immigrated to Egypt and established the ""Maymaniyah Press"" in 1859 which later became ""Al-Babi Al-Halabi Press"". Ahmad was infertile so he brought his nephews from Aleppo to carry on the business. The business later split into two entities, where Eissa Al-Halabi established the House of Revival of Arabic Books ""دار إحياء الكتب العربية"", while Mustafa Al-Halabi, the owner of this funerary enclosure, established the ""Mustafa Al-Babi Al-Halabi and Sons Library and Printing Company"". The printing house was mainly concerned with publishing avant-garde Islamic studies books like ""Al-Tabari and Al-Ghazali"". The print house still exists and is run by his descendants, located in al-Darrasa a few hundred meters away from the funerary enclosure and is also close to Al-Halabi Square, which might be named after him. _x000d_

The broader northern part is a well-maintained garden including only one new brick cenotaph. The narrower southern section contains: a domed burial chamber in the south-western corner, rectangular and protruding into the garden beyond the wall dividing the enclosure; a residential unit in the south-eastern corne of the enclosure; and another residential unit in the middle, with narow courtyards to the sides and a passage between it and the southern perimeter wall._x000d_
The enclosure has two entrances: the in the nothern perimeter wall is a simply decorated wrought-iron gate leading to the garden section of the enclosure. The entrance on the eastern side leads from the Sultan Ahmad Street to the building with the street façade that features an asymmetrically placed wide gate covered with a segmental arch, simply decorated with Mamluk-inspired knotted moldings, over which a marble panel with a single line of inscription is placed. There is a single window to the left of the gate and two on the right, all rectangular and with Mamluk-inspired knotted moulding framing around the lintels with segmental relieving arches above them. The building includes a reception space and two guest rooms with a small toilet and kitchen. This space is currently used as residential house for the doorman._x000d_
Another free-standing simple structure in the middle of the southern section of the enclosure was also used as a residential space for the visitors but was inaccessible at the time of recording. The third concrete-and-brick structure is the burial chamber located in the north-western corner of the enclosure. It is a one-story building with a large concrete dome in the middle, wider than the walled-off southern part of the enclosure, i.e., protruding into the garden. The facades of the burial chamber and the wall dividing the enclosure are decorated with simple Mamluk-inspired knotted moulding and are topped with rather complex fleur-de-lys crenellations prefabricated as reinforced concrete slabs. The huge rectangular windows of the burial chamber are in the easten and northern façades grouped in pairs within shallow rectangular recesses topped with simple muqarnases, while these in the western and southern façades are much smaller, placed in pairs and covered with pointed arches. The rectangular entrance door of the mausoleum in the middle of the eastern façade is placed in a shallow pointed-arched recess in the entrance section of the elevation which is taller than the rest of the wall, forming a pishtaq (Petersen, p.234). All facades have recently been covered with thick textured cement plaster that obscures the details of decoration. It is applied over the original, much finer plaster, which was painted in red and beige-yellow stripes imitationg ablaq masonry (Petersen, p.1-2.) The burial chamber is a large space divided into three internal sections by wide, flat elliptical arches resting on squat Islamic-style columns standing by the walls on high pedestals. The central space in the center is covered a dome on an octogonal drum that incorporates a muqarnas zone-of-transition and is supported by pointed-arched squinches in the corners. The single marble cenotaph placed under the dome is unusual in featuring open books sculpted in marble on its both ends. The central space is separated by wooden mashrabiya screens from the side chambers that are used as reception spaces and contain finely decorated Islamic-style wooden furniture. There is a dado of multicolour terrazzo around the walls of the burial chamber, and above it, a band of intricate Islamic arabesque floral pattern. The interior of the dome, its drum and base, decorative panels over the windows, and the ceilings of the side chambers and muqarnas friezes under on top of the walls are very richly decorated with colourful painted Islamic geometric and floral patterns and calligraphic inscriptions panels.","The buildings and the garden are well maintained. However, some of the crenellations in the internal separating wall between the buildings and the garden are broken or missing. The external walls, originally painted in two-tone imitation of ablaq masonry, have recently been covered with a layer of brownish gray textured cement plaster that obscures architectural decoration.","Tal‘at Harb (25 November 1867 – 13 August 1941) was a leading Egyptian entrepreneur and founder of Banque Misr, and its group of companies, in May 1920. (Wucher King, p.193-4). The establishment of Banque Misr, the first real Egyptian bank owned by Egyptian shareholders and staffed by Egyptian nationals, where Arabic (the national language) was used in all communications, was a major step in establishing a national economic identity. The idea of establishing Banque Misr first emerged in 1907, when Tal‘at Harb contributed 100 EGP to the establishment of al-Ahly Sporting Club. He was a renowned nationalist industrialist; he published books calling for the founding of a national bank with Egyptian financing.

•	The long gateway with the sequence of three elaborately decorated gates _x000d_
•	A huge alabaster bathtub randomly thrown in the garden","The largest and most decorated funerary enclosure documented in this research is a one-story stone-built walled enclosure, with the main entrance in the formally designed elaborate eastern façade. The façade is articulated with engaged columns in two tiers, without an inter-story cornice. The main gate is flanked by two massive buttresses with engaged corner columns topped with Islamic-style geometric capitals in the lower story and panels of geometric pattern above, which --like the gate itself-- are framed in knotted mouldings. The gateway section is taller than the rest of the façade, topped with elaborate fleur-de-lys crenelations, and is the only section of the façade clearly based on Islamic architectural tradition. On both ends of the façade are flat projections framed with triple engaged columns, each with a tall pointed-arch window and a small rectangular marble-framed window above. The sections of the façade between the gateway and the side projections are each divided into three bays by engaged columns: round and with composite order capitals in the lower tier and semi-octagonal with simple geometric capitals in the upper tier. Each bay has a large rectangular window in the lower level with a marble lintel and a segmental relieving arch above it, over which is placed a smaller oval window in marble framing, those in the central bays having the oval window within a rectangular marble frame. (The façade therefore gives the impression of a double-storied building, while in fact behind it are single full-height halls.) _x000d_
The round-arched main entrance leads into a long passage divided into two chambers by a gate in the middle, which is pointed-arched and fitted with extremely elaborate double-leaved wooden coffered door in Gothic Revival style, with an iron openwork in the arch over the lintel in Gothic tracery motifs. To the right side of the gateway is a huge hall with a mihrab in its shorter wall, originally divided into three aisles perpendicular to the main façade (and not related to its architectural divisions) by two rows of four columns each. The capitals are in Islamic style, decorated with muqarnases. The southern row of columns has largely collapsed, and the roof is missing. The hall is accessible from the first vestibule through a huge arched doorway flanked by two smaller doors, and also from the second vestibule through an arched gate placed in the middle of a façade with huge rectangular windows in two tiers._x000d_
To the left of the gateway is a large room along the main façade, now used for storage purposes, and behind it, a set of smaller rooms, now much altered. The northern internal elevation of the first vestibule is decorated with stone medallions including the initials of Khedive Isma‘il (K.I.), the right one being a mirror image._x000d_
In the southern lateral façade, the windows (of the huge three-aisled hall) are placed high and are double arched windows divided by piers with engaged colonettes and topped by an oculus in a fashion reminiscent of Mamluk fenestration. The windows of the northern lateral façade are huge, rectangular, placed low and fitted with iron grilles._x000d_
The third gate leads from the second vestibule to a huge garden, currently including four free-standing residential buildings Three of them are constructed of red bricks, while the fourth imitates in stone the features of the enclosure’s façade. A luxurious ornate bathtub of a huge monolithic piece of alabaster, apparently dating back to Khedive Isma‘il’s era is randomly thrown in the garden.","The general structural condition of the enclosure is poor_x000d_
The roof of the huge prayer hall south of the gateway chamber has fallen, as has much of the southern row of columns in the hall.","Ibrahim Pasha, son of the ruler of Egypt and founder of the dynasty Muhammad ‘Ali Pasha built a palace known under the name The High Palace in 1820 in what is now known as Garden City. It hosted the first meeting of the Egyptian advisory council “Majlis al-Mashoura” on 2 December 1829. After ‘Abbas Hilmi I assumed power, he donated the High Palace and its appurtenances in 1848 to Isma'il Bey, later Khedive Isma'il, who later sold the palace to his mother Hoshiyar Hanim Qadin in 1863. Khedive Isma'il’s remodelling of the palace is evidenced by his initials (K.I. - Khedive Isma'il) carved in stone in the gateway, still existing on the current remnants located in the Desert of the Mamluks. Hoshiyar Hanim Qadin took good care of the building until it was returned to the Egyptian Government in 1880. It was subsequently sold in 1898 to “al-Dayra al-Sunnya”, who sold it finally to the real estate company Charles Bacchus. The company demolished the palace in 1906 and sold its ruins, luxurious furniture, precious antiques, and rare garden trees (Negm, 2002). One of the façades of the High Palace was purchased by Sheikh ‘Ali al-Waqad and rebuilt in the Desert of the Mamluks. (El Kadi and Bonnamy, 2007, the date 1870 in this publication is certainly mistaken.) Two photographs in the collection of the Musée Nicéphore Niépce in Chalon sur Saône in France show the street façade of the High Palace before the transfer, clearly showing architectural elements now in the façade of the al-Waqqad family funerary enclosure. It is evident, however, that after the transfer, these elements were put in a different order in a differently designed façade. The present façade is straight, while in the original one, the entrance gate was placed in a deep recess. Moreover, what used to be an external gate on a street is now a gate between the first and second open vestibules. The photographs with numbers MNN 96.33.222 and MNN 96.33.223 are available in the Museum’s online collection : https://www.open-museeniepce.com/accueil _x000d_

Sheikh ‘Ali al-Waqqad was a pioneer of the bamboo industry in Egypt. He opened a factory on Queen Nazli Street (currently Ramses), where French labourers processed bamboo imported from India. After a dispute over wages in 1920 the French workers left and the factory was threatened with closure. However, the sheikh insisted on continuing the operation of the factory and entrusted the task to his son Muhammad. He trained Egyptian workers who replaced the French, and that area in Ramses Street is still famous for the bamboo industry, with the most important businesses owned by the descendants of students of Muhammad ‘Ali al-Waqqad (Ahmad al-Waqad, 2018)._x000d_
It appears that the façade and gateway that were transferred to the Desert of the Mamluks by al-Waqad family date to the times of Khedive Isma’il, judging from the style of their architecture. It uses Gothic Revival forms in a rather generic way, similar to other early Orientalist buildings in Cairo, such as the Gezira Palace (1869), and not the neo-Mamluk forms that were used after the work of the Comite de Conservation des Monuments de l’Art Arabe from 1882 on made the Mamluk architecture better known, resulting in such works as the al-Rifa’i Mosque (completed 1905, designed by Max Herz)._x000d_
The date 1292 in the grille in the arch of the main gate translates to AD 1875. At that time, Khedive Isma‘il was in a precarious financial condition, and burdened with enormous debt, which forced him to sell in that year his shares in the Suez Canal for a fraction of their value (Thompson, p.248). The date is therefore unlikely to be of original construction. This is also suggested by the very crude execution of the plaque with the date, incompatible with the details of other metalwork in the building.","•	Grand, Pierre Bey, Plan général de la Ville du Caire, available online in the American University in Cairo’s Rare Books and Special Collections Digital Library_x000d_

The northern and eastern elevations are plain, covered with a simple classical-style corniche, and plastered. The north elevation is divided into bays with vertical stripes of ashlar stone masonry. Huge rectangular windows are plain, and the gate in the middle of the east façade has very simple architectural framing with no neo-Mamluk elements.

The entrance gate section is taller than the rest of the façade, forming a pishtaq (Petersen, p.234). The rectangular entrance door with knotted moulding framing similar to these over the windows is set in a wide recess covered with very elaborate muqarnas hood of five tiers of “stalactite” muqarnas niches. Two gals seats flank the doorway to the sides of its recess in a typically Mamluk manner (Amin & Ibrahim, p. 30). The decorated door-leaves feature neo-classical, not neo-Mamluk motifs.

wider recess with a pair of narrow windows, while at the northern end is a sabil placed in a chamfered corner, with a central window fitted with a marble ledge and two side windows._x000d_
The two gateways are on the main axis opposite each other and lead to the central courtyard. There are two residential flats on either side of the main entrance on the western side, two rooms on either side of the secondary entrance, and two burial chambers extending at the southern and the northern sides, all overlooking an enclosed courtyard with a garden layout. _x000d_
The burial chamber on the southern side contains two limestone cenotaphs and three decorative marble cenotaphs. The other chamber is on the northern side and contains five decorative marble cenotaphs, one simple marble cenotaph, and one wooden cenotaph.","The enclosure is in a good condition but lower parts of the walls are seriously damaged by moisture. The roof has recently been repaired and new drainage pipes installed. The relieving arches over doors and windows in the stone sections of the façade have recently been crudely filled in with mortar, which suggests that decorative ceramic tiles were recently stolen from them.","A small, apparently modern inscription plaque by the main entrance door gives the name of Mahmud Fahmi al-Nuqrashi Pasha, the Prime Minister. _x000d_
Mahmud al-Nuqrashi was an Egyptian politician. After resigning in 1937 from the Wafd party then lead by Mustafa Nahas (whose likely heir he was considered), al-Nuqrashi founded with Ahmad Mahir in January 1938 the S‘adist Party which claimed to be the true heirs to Wafd’s founder S‘ad Zaghlul. Mahmud al-Nuqrashi held various ministerial posts in the 1930s and 40s, served as Prime Minister from February 1945 for one year, and then again from December 1946 until his death. On 8 December 1948 he outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood he was assassinated by its member Twenty days later. (Wucher King, p.491-2; Vatikiotis, p.364-7)._x000d_
The date AH 1305 on a cenotaph inside corresponds to AD 1888. This seems too early for the front façade designed in historically accurate neo-Mamluk style, but does not seem improbable for the back and side facades and the back gateway. It is not impossible that the front façade is a later remodelling._x000d_

In the centre of the eastern façade of the perimeter wall is a more elaborate neo-Mamluk gate set in a shallow rectangular recess topped with a three-tiered muqarnas and framed in knotted mouldings. The relieving arch over the flat lintel has joggled voussoirs. The gate is in a pishtaq higher than the rest of the perimeter wall and is crowned with decorative crenellations. Both the crenellations and the muqarnas are of a different design than those on the mausoleum. The sabil window in the north-western corner of the enclosure is blocked with bricks and cement. The sabil is inaccessible due to massive plant overgrowth in this part of the enclosure._x000d_
The cubical mausoleum has facades of ashlar stone masonry crowned with decorative crenellations of elaborate form emulating late Circassan Mamluk period and engaged columns in the corners. The side and façades each have a single rectangular window with a flat arch forming the lintel and a segmental relieving arch above it, and over it a small round window. The windows are placed in wide shallow recesses topped with simple two-tiered small muqarnases. In the entrance façades, the doors have identical arrangement of the lintel and an oculus above as the windows in other facades, but it is not placed in a recess and is flanked by two narrow recesses without muqarnas tops. The wooden door and the window have a simple decoration of mafruqa panels._x000d_
Inside, there are three elaborately carved marble cenotaphs bearing the names of Ahmad Khairi Pasha’s wives, two simpler, newer marble cenotaphs, and a modern brick-built cenotaph. The door and windows lintels are framed in knotted mouldings, and above each is a round qamariya gypsum grille with a vase of flowers surrounded by an inscription. The ceiling has a central skylight and is painted in simple Ottoman Baroque-style motifs around the edges of the ceiling compartments with similar motifs in the centre.","The bottom parts of the wall are seriously affected by rising damp, with the stones powdering. To mask the damage, the lower parts of the walls have been covered by modern facing of small limestone tiles, which itself is powdering now. The cracks in the southern corner of the entrance façade and in the lintel over the window in the south-western façade indicate differential settlement of the foundations. Otherwise, the unit is in fair condition.","Previously, the enclosure used to be a walled complex comprising al-Baqli family enclosure and al-Sanhawi enclosure sharing a courtyard, before the family separated the complex, turning it into an independent unit.

Below, two diamond-positioned square inscriptions to the sides contain the shahada. The door and windows are fitted with wrought-iron grilles with decoration of simple Art Noveau-inspired design. In the relieving arches over the openings are painted glazed ceramic tiles. They do not form regular patterns, but are randomly placed fragmentary pieces of an Ottoman-style wall decoration. This may either result from the tiles being genuine Ottoman-period Iznik or Kütahia tiles (or their Syrian imitations), or else from the designer’s desire to create such an impression. Behind the front façade is an open loggia with concrete roof supported on two square stone pillars with chamfered corners. The side (southern) elevation is much lower than the building on the front side, with a stepped transitional section.

The northern courtyard is slightly irregular and measures approximately 21 x 23 -25 metres, with the south-eastern corner taken away by a neighbouring funerary enclosure; the southern one measures approximately 8.5 x 16 metres. They share a long continuous long western wall. The northern courtyard is accessed through simple stone gates in the western and northern walls, topped with semi-circular arches. By the eastern wall are three single-storied service / residential rooms. In the north-western corner is a huge rectangular hall with undecorated interior, furnished with huge elaborate wooden benches/sofas for gatherings of visitors. In the south-western corner is a square burial chamber. Its northern and eastern façades are tripartite, with a door in the muddle flanked by two windows, all covered with steeply pointed arches. The three arches are framed together in simple and ungainly knotted moulding in plastered. The mausoleum is topped with a simple moulding and fleur-de-lys crenellations cast in plaster of cement. Otherwise, the walls of all the rooms in the courtyard are devoid of decoration.  The mausoleum window shutters and door leaves are panelled, with simple mafruka patterns. The window panes over the arches have coloured glazing in decorative, mafruka-based simple divisions. The window sashes also have simple decorative divisions. The roof of the burial chamber rests on four wooden columns on tall pedestals and of very simple Tuscan capitals. The columns carry simple brackets supporting beams that carry a wooden structure of a dome drum. (There is no zone-of-transition, so technically speaking, the structure is a roof lantern rather than a dome.) The drum is twelve-sided, pierced with six windows with coloured glazing in panels of simple mafruka-based patterns. On the polygonal drum sits a round dome, which results in awkward overhangs both inside and outside. The exterior of the dome is ribbed._x000d_
Between the columns are placed elaborate wooden screens featuring turned-wood mashrabiya panels and mother-of-pearl inlays that form an enclosure (Ar: “maqsura”) around the wooden cenotaph of Shaykh Hasuna, which is covered with a cloth bearing elaborate calligraphic inscriptions._x000d_
Above the northern door of the mausoleum is a half of very badly damaged stucco [?] inscription panel including the name Shaykh … Hasuna al-Nawawi and date 22 [?] Shawwal AH 1343 [corresponding to 15 May AD 1925.]_x000d_
The northern section of the courtyard (between the rooms in north-western and north-eastern corners) is screened off with a large panelled wooden screen with horseshoe arched openings in the upper part._x000d_
_x000d_
The smaller southern courtyard is an open enclosure, with no rooms within. Its southern wall is composed of four stone pillars, between which are short sections of picket fence and two openwork iron gates of slightly different widths._x000d_
In the northern wall is the simple rectangular door to the northern courtyard, and a wide low window of the burial chamber, fitted with w wrought-iron grille of simple, Art Nouveau-inspired pattern. By the western and northern walls stand five rather simple carved marble cenotaphs, the most recent bearing the date AD 1976, the most elaborately decorated one dated to AH 1371 [corresponding to AD 1952.] On the latter cenotaph is an inscription in raised relief that was evidently added at a later date, referring to ‘Abd al-Khaliq Hasuna and giving the date 1992.","The unit is in overall fair condition and maintained. It has recently been renovated, with new coats of paint to the walls, repairs to walls damaged by rising damp, and repairs to and repainting of some woodwork. The relatively recent cenotaphs in the southern part of the southern courtyard have been damaged by rising damp, and were recently rather unprofessionally repaired.","Shaykh Hasuna al-Nawawi (1839 – 1925, buried in the mausoleum in the northern courtyard) was twice the Saykh of al-Azhar in 1895 – 99 and 1907 – 1910, member of the Supreme Council of the Shariya Court in 1895, and the Grand Mufti of Egypt in 1895 – 1899. He strove to improve educational standards at al-Azhar and to introduce modern sciences (Street Story website). _x000d_
Muhammad ‘Abd al-Khaliq Hasuna (1898 – 1992, buried in the southern courtyard) was an Egyptian diplomat and statesman. He held the positions of the Director of the Foreign Office from 1932 to 1934; Director of Political and Business Affairs from 1934 to 1938; Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1938 to 1940; The first Undersecretary of the Ministry of Social Affairs from 1940 to 1942; Governor of Alexandria from 1942 to 1948; Ambassador and Undersecretary of State from 1948 to 1949; Minister of Social Affairs from 1949 to 1950; Minister of Education in 1952; and Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1952.

There is a main single-storey L-shaped building by the main and about half of the northern facades, and a subsidiary single-storey building in the south-western corner of the enclosure. The rest of the lot is an open courtyard planted with trees, with simple wooden verandas (now much dilapidated) by the southern and western facades of the main building and the eastern façade of the subsidiary building. External and courtyard façades of the complex are all in a highly simplified, Classically-inspired style, without any neo-Mamluk or otherwise Islamic elements. In the axially arranged entrance façade, a centrally placed entrance gate is topped with a boldly rusticated semi-circular arch, with decoratively panelled wooden door and a simple decorative wrought iron grille in the arch above. There are two huge plain rectangular windows to the left (north) right (south) sides of the gate, all fitted with simple, plain louvre shutters and simple decorative wrought iron grilles. The north-eastern corner is rounded, with a huge, plain rectangular sabil window with simple panelled shutters and a simple decorative wrought iron grille. There is a simple rectangular recess over the sabil window, evidently intended for an inscription panel, but now empty. A secondary gate in the southern façade leads directly to the courtyard. The corners of the enclosure, framings of the gates, and the cornice are bult of ashlar stone, the rest of the walls are constructed of rough stone, those of the western part of the enclosure left unplastered. The front façade and eastern parts of the north and south facades are topper with simple classical cornice._x000d_
The entrance door leads to a huge hallway leading to the courtyard, with doors leading to two burial chambers on either side, in the two wings of the building that also include residential and service rooms. _x000d_
The southern burial chamber is a plain undecorated room covered with a ceiling with exposed wooden roofing beams resting on doubled steel C-beams, which are supported by two simple wooden posts.

The interior decoration of the northern burial chamber belies the austerity of the external look of the building. It is divided into three sections, the side sections extending further to the west than the square central one. The southern section, accessed from the hallway to its south, is a vestibule separated from the rest of the burial chamber with a tall, very elaborate wooden screen of turned-wood mashrabiya panels and openwork patterns, with a double-leaf door in its left (western)part leading to the central section of the chamber. In the southern section stand two simple marble cenotaphs dated to the 1930s.The wooden ceiling has exposed chamfered and moulded beams and is painted in colourful geometric patterns. The window in the eastern wall, as well as windows of the eastern and western walls of the central section are fitted with internal wooden shutters of mashrabiya panels and wooden frames decorated with knotted mouldings. _x000d_
The square central section is covered with an extremely elaborate wooden ceiling divided into rectangular panels and bands separating them filled with nailed-on lath forming complex Islamic geometric patterns, colourfully painted. Over the middle square is an octagonal lantern with windows filled with qamariyat grilles and the octagonal ceiling resting on a wooden muqarnas frieze. In the western part of the central hall stands an elaborately carved marble cenotaph dated 1336 / 1918. Between the central and the side sections stand two wooden pillars that carry elaborate corbels carrying transverse beams and separating the sections of the burial chamber; the corbels (termed “kurdi”) and the beams are richly painted in arabesque patterns. _x000d_
The northern section has a wooden ceiling with colourful geometric pattern painted on its flat underside boarding. A structural beam of double steel C-beams close to the central section has decorative corbels of mashrabiya panels. The lower parts of the walls are covered with wooden boarding with painted in imitation of niches with colonnettes. The windows in the northern section have elaborate internal shutters of mashrabiya panels and a mashrabiya cornice, and a door in the western wall has a similar frame and cornice, and door-leaves painted in geometric pattens. The north-eastern corner of this section is rounded and includes the sabil window. In the northern section of the burial chamber stands a simple marble cenotaph with no shahid stelae, with calligraphic panels in fine script it raised relief, signed by the calligrapher.","The larger cenotaph in the southern burial chamber bears the name of Lady Shafiqa Hanim, the daughter of the late Amin Pasha Fikri who died in the afternoon of the first day of Dhu al-Higga 1330 AH [= 10 November AD 1912].

Another rectangular single-storey building stands by the southern wall, forming a front courtyard in the south-eastern corner of the enclosure. The main portal and adjoining parts of the façade, the secondary gate in the northern façade, the base course and the cornice are built of ashlar stone. The rest of the walls are built of rough stone, divided into sections by ashlar stone pillars. There is no evidence that the rough stone sections were ever plastered, although the building does not appear to be unfinished._x000d_
In the front façade, the main portal is asymmetrically placed closer to the northern end, and forms a pishtaq twice the height of the rest of the walls, topped with huge fleur-de-lys crenellations. The entrance is placed in a recess topped with a trefoil hood with a fluted semi-dome in the upper part resting on a very elaborate muqarnas frieze with “stalactite” muqarnases. The recess is framed in knotted mouldings. The composition follows very closely the forms of Mamluk-period architecture in Cairo. The rectangular entrance door has its lintel, which is a flat arch of limestone blocks, and a segmental relieving arch above it framed in knotted mouldings. Over the door is a rectangular recess in moulded frame, evidently intended for an inscription panel, but now empty. There are two narrow undecorated windows with flat-arch lintels flanking the portal, and two large, plain rectangular windows in the right (northern) section of the façade. The wider left section of the façade (now ruined) that formed the wall of the south-eastern courtyard apparently was blank, with no windows.

The complex is divided into a huge rectangular courtyard taking the western part of the enclosure and a narrower eastern section.  The eastern section consists of (1) the northern courtyard accessed through a gate in its eastern wall, with a small single-storey service building in the north-eastern corner; (2) the southern courtyard, also accessed through a gate in its eastern wall, and with a tract of rooms by its southern side that includes a round-fronted sabil in the south-eastern corner of the enclosure. The courtyards are separated by a building that was apparently originally accessed from either of them._x000d_
The western courtyard is accessible through the gates in the western walls of courtyards (1) and (2), and originally also directly through two gates in its southern and northern walls (now walled up.) The western courtyard contains (3) a free-standing mausoleum; (4) a service building by the southern wall; (5) an open burial area in the north-western corner of the enclosure._x000d_
(1) The northern courtyard is separated from the street with a picket fence of wrought iron with simple decorative patterns, with a two-leaved wrought iron gate between two square pillars of stonemasonry with prominent cornices on muqarnas corbels with two merlons of elaborate fleur-de-lys crenellation on each side, with bulbous ornaments on top (which amounts to a rather top-heavy design.) The single-storey service building in the north-eastern corner is simple and undecorated, with the entrance in the southern wall and a single plain window in the northern and eastern walls. The western side of the courtyard is a low wall with a balustrade of classical (not Islamic) balusters (the wall was recently heightened over the balustrade.) A gate of two wrought iron and sheet metal leaves placed between pillars similar to those in the front gate (but with lighter crenellations) leads to the western courtyard._x000d_
The southern side of the courtyard is the northern wall of the single-storey building standing between the southern and northern courtyards. The simple, undecorated symmetrical façade features an entrance porch elevated about one metre above the courtyard level, with rectangular openings to the sides and two rectangular openings flanking an arched one at the front (in an extremely simplified version of a Venetian window arrangement.) On the sides of the porch are mounted two hanging lamps on elaborate Art Nouveau wrought iron brackets. There is a simple rectangular window in the façade on each side of the porch. Apparently, the building was topped with a simple cornice, which has now mostly been removed, except from the street-facing façade, which is plain and simple, with two rectangular windows._x000d_
(2) The southern courtyard was designed as essentially symmetrical to the northern one, with the difference that the whole southern side is taken by a tract of rooms, and the gate in back (western) side leading to the western courtyard is covered with a segmental arch, flanked by simplified pilasters, and topped with crenellations. The entrance porch of the building to the north has been walled up, and modern nondescript shacks built against it. The sabil in the south-eastern corner of the enclosure is a round-fronted structure with three rectangular sabil windows fitted with iron grilles, set between two short side wings with another sabil window in each. Above, there is an upper tier of pointed-arch windows. However, there is no upper storey, so the upper windows are opening in a tall parapet. The windows of the sabil are framed in knotted mouldings and set in shallow recesses that taper in steps towards the top and are covered with muqarnas friezes in the round part, and with simple pointed horseshoe arches in the straight sections. The walls of the sabil are crowned with elaborate fleur-de-lys muqarnases._x000d_
(3) The mausoleum is square in plan, and positioned at an angle to the perimeter walls and other buildings in the complex to conform to the direction towards Mecca. This is surprising, considering that the Mecca-facing wall is the entrance façade, with the door where a prayer niche would typically be placed. The design of the mausoleum is strictly axially symmetrical. The entrance portal forms a pishtaq much taller than the other façades. The entrance is placed in a recess topped with a trefoil hood with a pointed semi-dome in the upper part (in which the word “Allah” is boldly painted) resting on a very elaborate muqarnas frieze with “stalactite” muqarnases. The composition follows closely the forms of Mamluk-period architecture in Cairo. Over the entrance recess is a panel with a very elaborate calligraphic dedicatory inscription that includes the date 1338 AH [= AD 1920]. The recess and the inscription panel are framed in knotted mouldings. Over the entrance door (which could not be accessed for description) is a pointed-arch window framed in knotted mouldings. The entrance section is crowned with an elaborate muqarnas frieze._x000d_
The windows of the mausoleum are placed in shallow rectangular recesses topped with muqarnas friezes and are placed in two tiers; the lower ones are rectangular, with relieving arches of joggled voussoirs, and the upper ones are twinned and covered with semi-circular arches with an oculus above in a one-over-two arrangement. The lintels, relieving arches above them and lower parts of the upper tier windows are framed in knotted mouldings in the front façade (but not in the side and back façades.) There are two window recesses in each façade, with the entrance portal between them in the eastern façade, and with blank walls in the other façades. In the corners of the mausoleum are engaged columns with muqarnas capitals. Over the middle of the mausoleum chamber is a tall roof lantern, square in plan and covered with a flat slab. Its four walls are pierced with plain triple windows covered with semi-circular arches with oculi above in a one-over-two-over-three arrangement. The windows are placed in flat recesses topped with muqarnas friezes at the top of the walls. The mausoleum walls, its lantern, the western gate in the southern courtyard, and the pillars of the two gates in the eastern façade of the enclosure are topped with large crenellations of complex fleur-de-lys based forms reminiscent of the late-Mamluk forms typical of the reign of Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri (reigned 1501 – 1516.)_x000d_
(4) The building in the south-eastern corner of the western courtyard is simple, with the northern façade identical with this of the building between the eastern-side courtyards, i.e., with an entrance porch, and three simple large windows in the southern façade facing the street._x000d_
(5) In the open rectangular burial area in the north-western corner of the western courtyard stand three tomb markers (inaccessible for closer inspection)._x000d_
The mausoleum, the sabil, gates, corners of the enclosure, etc. are built of ashlar stone, other walls are constructed of rough stone and plastered. The northern and southern gates of the enclosure (now walled up) were taller than the adjoining walls and arched.","The complex is in good condition and continuously maintained. The lower parts of the walls, especially in the sabil, are damaged by rising damp.","Omar Makram was the Naqib al-Ashraf, or the leader of those who claim descent from the Prophet Muhammad, during the French occupation of Egypt in 1798-1801. He was the leader of poplar opposition to the occupation, and after the French withdrawal was instrumental in promoting the installation of Muhammad ‘Ali as the viceroy of Egypt, although their relationship later deteriorated. He has been widely perceived as the precursor by Egyptian nationalists (Wucher King, 415-16, Vatikiotis, p.39, 51). He died in 1811 and is buried in the Eastern Cemetery just over a kilometre to the south of the family enclosure; his tomb has recently (around 2020) been registered as a national monument, based on the historical importance of the deceased, not on architectural merit. It is not known why the family did not transfer his body to the sumptuous mausoleum._x000d_

In the window is a very simple decorative grille welded from pieces if rolled iron. Above the window is a roundel with a Qur’anic inscription carved into the surface of the wall. It imitates the form of the blazons with royal titles (rank) that were used on buildings founded by Mamluk sultans (examples abound in the neighbourhood.) Over the roundel is an inscription panel that includes the date AH 1312. Another inscription carved over the entrance door includes the name Muhammad Khairallah and the date AH 1321. The portal and the sabil door are the only elements of the building in neo-Mamluk style. They follow the mediaeval Mamluk patterns quite closely, while the quality of craftsmanship is good, but not outstanding, and overall, the unit is a modest one. _x000d_
There is a plain rectangular window with a simple, non-decorative iron grille and simple panelled shutters to the right (west) of the portal, and two more such windows in the plain western façade, which is undecorated save a simple cornice.

 According to the keeper, before 2004 the residential part was used by a charity for educational classes for girls and for literacy courses. After 2004, it was turned into steel, leather, and bamboo-working workshops.

•	Double crenelations aligned with both sides of the walls_x000D_
•	Uninscribed tomb markers","The enclosure is composed of various disparate parts, possibly due to its remodelling from an earlier structure (see point 17.) It comprises a roughly square courtyard with its eastern side facing the Sultan Ahmad Street and a smaller courtyard attached on the western side, with one side cut obliquely to conform to the line of the back street. The south-western corner of the main courtyard is also slightly irregular and cut obliquely. A burial courtyard occupies the south-eastern  quarter of the enclosure and contains two identical simple uninscribed limestone tomb markers. Its walls are well-built of huge blocks of stone (in the street façade with alternating smooth and rusticated courses.) The eastern and western sides are each pierced with four square windows with lintels of remarkably well-built flat arches of single keystones wedged between two cantilevered blocks, while the southern wall neighbouring on another lot has identical four blind niches. The northern wall is tripartite with the entrance door in the midde and a window to each side. In the windows and the entrance door are simple iron grilles of mafruqa-based geometric pattern. The windows on the Sultan Ahmad Street have been grudely walled up and the wall was hightened with a crudely excuted wall._x000D_
The front façade on Sultan Ahmad Street is composed of three varied units: To the left (south) of the centrally placed entrance gate is the façade of the burial courtyard. The slightly protruding gate section is taller, with a gate placed in a shallow recess covered with a bevelled keel arch. Over the door is a stone lintel with an inscription panel containing  the verse 15:46 (in surat al-hig’r) of the Qur’an: “Enter ye here in peace and security” (translation: Yusuf ‘Ali), and in the arch is a double-sided panel with a floral Islamic arabesque pattern on the front (street) side and a geometric pattern on the interior side. Diamond-positioned squares to the sides of the arch contain inscriptions “Allah” and “Muhammad”. The panelled wooden double-leaver door is decorated with mafruqa pattern (Amin and Ibrahim, p.112) in upper and lower parts. The gate is accessed by 5 descending steps._x000D_
The section of the front façade right (north) of the entrance is slightly taller than the gate section and belongs to the building in the north-eastern corner of the enclosure. Its street elevation has in its right (northern) section two shallow rectangular recesses topper with cavetto cornices, with a pair of windows in each one. The windows are separated by a tall chamfered pillar and over plain blocks of slightly cantilevered impost stones are covered with rectilinear keel arches. The lower, rectangular parts of the windows are fitted with grilles with square openings in thick turned-wood mashrabiya screeens, while the interiors of the rectilinear arches aabove are filled with fine mashrabiya turned-wood screens of hexagonal patterns. In the left part of the façade are two wide openings covered with flat keel arches resting on simple corbels. In the lower parts of the openings are solid balustrades of two bays, with “pomegranade” ornaments over the vertical stands. The openings are fitted with iron grilles of the same pattern as those in the windows of the burial courtyard (now invisible, as the openings are crudely blocked with plywood.) Inside the enclosure, the building is surrounded on its western and southern sides with porticos of wide stone keel arches on square, chamfered stone pillars – three arches in the W façade, and two arches separated by a narrow rectangular opening between the pillars in the S façade. The portico is elevated on four steps over the courtyard level. Two doors in the W wall inside the portico and one in the S wall have a typically Mamluk decoration of knotted mouldings that frame the lintels and flat arches of joggled voissioirs over segmental relieving arches; the panelled wooden double-leaver door leaves are decorated with mafruqa pattern. The building contains a two-bedroom apartment with a toilet._x000D_
Another small building, lower than the perimeter wall, is located in the south-western corner of the enclosure, with the back wall slanting obliquely. It consists of two rooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen. The door and and window of the northern room are of the same design as in the front building, while the shallow southern room opened onto the curtyard with a wide keel arch (now obscured by a modern nondescript shack.) Next to the building is the door in the western wall leading to the back courtyard (inaccessible at the time of recording.) By the middle of the back wall is a nondescript modern brick-built two-room partment, and in front of it, a simple wooden pergola crossing the courtyard towards the passage between the front building and the burial courtyard to which the main gateway leads. By the southern wall of the enclosure are two simple stone tomb markers, and a richly decorated limestone cenotaph with a marble inscription panel on the shorter side. The cenotaph appears to predate the current complex which consistently uses simple, geometrical forms. Two more stone tomb-markers are located by the northern wall. A square in the middle of the courtyard is arranges as a simple garden._x000D_
The crenellations, which are peculiar in being double, separate for each side of the wall, have very simple, rectilinear geometric form throughout the complex._x000D_
A new water cooler inside the front building portico with a dispensing faucet and washbasin acessible from the street operates as a modern equivalent of a sabil. A tiny marble plaque next to the “sabil” reads: “their Lord will give them a pure drink” (the Qur’an, 76:21, surat al-insan, transl. Mohsin Khan.)_x000D_
The gate from the back street to the back courtyard is covered with a keel arch and has a wide plain flat framing with a simple moulding around. Over the gate is a sunken inscription panel with verse 13:24 (from surat al-ra‘d): “Peace unto you for that ye persevered in patience! Now how excellent is the final home!"" (Translation: Yusuf ‘Ali.)","The unit is overall in fair condition and reasonably well-maintained. The carved stone cenotaph has undergone inexpert attempts at repair. The external windows have been crudely blocked. In the areas exposed to water there is visible damage from rising damp. The deformed arch of the eastern bay of the portico of the front building (by the eastern wall of the enclosure), which is shored by a wooden prop, indicates differential settlement of foundations in this area, which is a serious structural problem.","The inscription on a marble plaque by the entrance gate states: “Burial ground of the Faid family. Created AH 1299, AD 1882, renewed AH 1368, AD 1948” It is clear from the architectural forms of the complex that it was entirely built anew in 1948._x000D_

The main (eastern) façade slants obliquely in relation to the rectangular lot, following the line of the street that runs at an angle to Sultan Ahmad street, to which the lots in the area are aligned. The strictly symmetrical tripartite façade features a central entrance gate to each side, a pair of windows covered by semicircular arches, separated by a pillar with an engabed semi-column but otherwise undecorated, with a small plain oculus above. The windows are fitted with decorative wrought-iron grilles of a vaguely Art Noveau design (not Islamic patterns), and simple panelled wooden shutters. The very slightly protruding entrance section is slightly higher and contains a rectangular recess topped with a cavetto cornice with a rectangular door, the lintel of which and the relieving arch above are surrounded by a plane rectangular frame (possibly intended to be carved into knotted mouldings but never finished?) The façade is topped by a simple stone cavetto cornice and simple fleur-de-lys crenellations. The corners and the sections with openings are built of ashlar stone, while the parts between them are built of rubble stone. The external facades are coated with yelow wash._x000D_
The secondary northern façade (longer side of the lot) is plain, built of rubble stone and plastered. It has an undecorated secondary entrance in its right section and two rectangular windows with grilles and shutters similar to those in the front façade. The window frames feature a wooden horseshoe arch in the upper part._x000D_
The main entrance leads to the vestibule that opens on the courtyard with a wide rectangular opening with a wooden-and-stained-glass screen including a glazed two-leaf door. Rooms in the north-eastern and south-eastern corners of the enclosure are accessed from the courtyard. The latter has a simple wooden porch on two slender posts._x000D_
The south-western quarter of the enclosure is taken by an elaborate free-standing canopy of rectangular plan, with a roof supported on three square slender wooden posts to each shorter side, and four to each longer side, and with four internal posts supporting the structure of the lantern. The roof ends wooden eaves with elaborate frills. The windows of the octagonal lantern are divided into geometric panes glazed with transparent and coloured glass.

The gateways, door- and window frames, corners, etc. are built of cut stone and plastered, and other sections of walls are constructed of rough stone and plastered. A gateway leads to the southern end of the wall facing the courtyard contained within the U-shaped building, which means that the entrance gate is placed asymmetrically in the main façade, with four windows to the left (north) and two windows to the right (south). The windows throughout the building are covered with semi-circular arches and plain except a flat plain, unmoulded frame around those in the front façade. They are fitted with simple decorative grilles of wrought iron and simple wooden louvre shutters. The southernmost window in the façade is slightly larger and is a sabil window with a plain marble edge and larger openings at the bottom of the grille. High on the wall between this and the next window is a rectangular marble panel sunken within a simple moulded frame, which contains nine calligraphic panels (in two columns + a centred bottom one) with an inscription carved in raised relief containing the date of foundation. The entrance gate has a simple, neo-classical-based banded framing and is fitted with huge double-leafed panelled door also of simplified neo-classical motifs and a radial wrought-iron grille over its wooden lintel, of a design similar to these in windows. The gate is slightly taller than the rest of the façade. The façade is topped with a simple neo-classical style moulding and simple fleur-de-lys crenelations which are the only Mamluk- or Islamic-related feature in the architecture of the building. The internal (courtyard) façades are plain, save a simple moulding on top of those facing the courtyard contained within the U-shaped building, with regularly placed openings. A larger door in the western wall of the courtyard leads to a shrine of Shaykh Muhammad al-Inbabi, whose tabut is enclosed within a very elaborate shrine constructed of mashrabiya turned-wood screens, with mother-of-pearl- and bone-inlaid panels. _x000D_
Besides the shrine, the building houses three residential apartments (including this of the keepers) and a carpentry workshop._x000D_

The tripartite façade stands on a moulded plinth course and features slender engaged columns with muqarnas capitals in the corners. The protruding central entrance section is taller than the rest of the façade, forming a pishtaq (Petersen, p.234). The entrance is set in a tall rectangular recess topped with an elaborate three-tiered muqarnas hood. In the corners of the entrance recess are engaged columns identical with those at the ends of the façade. Above the rectangular entrance door is a window flanked by two engaged colonnettes, with the covering trilobed arch integrated into the muqarnas frieze. The window does not belong to any room, as the upper part of the façade forms a tall parapet above the roof. The two-leaved wooden door are decorated with neo-classical based motifs, not Mamluk like the stonework of the façade._x000D_
The side sections of the façade feature centrally placed rectangular recesses covered with elaborate three-tiered muqarnas hoods. The rectangular windows are flanked with engaged corner colonettes with muqarnas capitals and are fitted with simple decorative wrought-iron grilles and simple wooden panelled shutters. Over the windows and the entrance door, the lintels and the relieving arches above them are surrounded by plain protruding frames, apparently intended to be carved into knotted mouldings in a typically Mamluk manner into knotted mouldings, but never completed. This gives the otherwise ornate façade a decidedly unfinished air. The façade is topped by a simple cornice and fleur-de-lys crenellations._x000D_
The side (northern) façade  is undecorated, built of rubble stone and plastered, and has three irregularly placed windows (one topped with a semi-circular arch, and two rectangular), and a secondary gate to the courtyard, built of cut stone and with a very simplified neo-classical derived architectural framing._x000D_
The entrance leads to a huge chamber covered with a wooden ceiling with a simple low octagonal lantern. In the southern part of the chamber are two limestone pedestals.

The decoration is of fine craftsmanship and accurately copies Mamluk-period architectural details (but not the design principles of Mamluk architecture, being strictly symmetrical.) The façades are free-standing decorative screens, because there is no building behind them, the only building within the enclosure being a small structure in the north-eastern corner._x000D_
The north-western corner at the junction of the decorated façades is rounded, and protrudes very slightly from the side walls. To both sides of the rounded corner are identical rectangular recesses topped with elaborate three-tiered muqarnases and each containing a rectangular window, with the lintel and the relieving arches above it surrounded by knotted mouldings in a typically Mamluk manner. The windows are fitted with simple decorative wrought-iron grilles and simple panelled wooden shutters.  In the corresponding recess in the rounded corner that extends to the ground level and is covered with a similar, but not identical muqarnas frieze, the window is placed one course lower, and has no knotted moulding framing. Above it is a marble panel with two lines of inscription in raised relief, placed in sunken round-ended panels. The inscription is a short poem related to drinking water. However, the window below hasn’t got a stone ledge, and there is no structure behind it, so it uncertain whether a sabil ever operated here. Further away from the rounded corner are muqarnas-covered recesses containing entrance gates with knotted moulding framing like those over the windows, similar, but not identical. The gate in the western façade is larger, and put in a very shallowly protruding section of the wall. Both gates are made of simple decorative wrought-iron grilles. Inside the recesses and above both gates are marble panels within sunken moulded framing, containing the same calligraphic inscription in high-quality raised relief, but in different scripts and differently distributed within calligraphic panels. The inscription is in poetic verse and states that Muhammad built the structure to commemorate his father Khalil Allah seven years after his death in AH 1318, in the year AH 1325._x000D_

The interior of the enclosure was inaccessible in the time of recording.","The enclosure is in a good overall condition.

It is located immediately west of the area that was a part (probably a service area) of Sultan Qaitbey’s large funerary complex of AD 1474 and that was later mostly built up with residential buildings. To the north of the unit is a nondescript building from the first half of the 20th century that is the last phase in remodelling and replacing the building within Sultan Qaitbey’s complex that included the back entrance to the personal-use part of the complex. (The gate is still preserved.) To the south are small open funerary enclosures. _x000D_
The main (western) façade faces a street that was a space outside the Sultan’s complex. There are three entrances in the facade. The northern one is a modestly decorated gate with a rounded arch that leads to an entrance hall. The windows of the rooms on either side of the hall and the gate form a symmetrical tripartite northern part of the facade. The windows, which are plain and covered with semi-circular arches, and the arch above the door are fitted with decorative wrought-iron grilles of patterns unrelated to Islamic art. Above, scant remnants of the upper floor wall are preserved, with the side of the northern window clearly visible. This part of the façade corresponds to what is now the funerary unit of Qasim Bey; the rooms behind the southern part of the uniformly built façade are currently used by different owners and accessible from behind, with front entrances permanently blocked._x000D_
The entrance hall leads to a small courtyard shared with the building neighbouring to the north and planted with palm trees and other greenery. On the southern side of the courtyard is a burial chamber. Its symmetrical façade has the door and the two flanking windows topped with horseshoe-shaped pointed arches fitted with geometric wooden grilles with stained glass panels behind. The burial chamber is built of bricks. On the eastern side it incorporates a section of an earlier wall. In the chamber stands a carved marble cenotaph that bears the date 3 Gomada al-Awwal AH 1325. The inscription in raised relief states that the person buried is Muhammad Qasim Bey al-Helu, a representative of the Sultan of Morocco in Egypt._x000D_
At the southern end of the façade is a recess topped with a trilobe arch with no mouldings. The recess is taller than the inter-storey cornice, which runs continuously around it. The lower part of the recess has been walled up. Just above the blocking, a segmental arch is visible, apparently a relieving arch over a door. Above, there is a rectangular recess with a hatched back surface indicating that an inscription panel (presumably of marble) was either installed there and removed, or was intended to be installed. Above is a rectangular window, now blocked. The wall surface is completely plain, with no mouldings or any other architectural decoration._x000D_
The original function of the portal is unclear. There is no visible structural discontinuity between the portal and the rest of the façade._x000D_
To the left (north) of the trilobed portal is a simple door covered with a segmental arch (now permanently closed) that according to the residents led to a staircase. This indicates that the upper floor was independently accessible, so it probably formed a separate residential unit.",The building is in poor overall condition and dilapidated. The upper floor is missing. There is serious damage from groundwater to the lower portions of the walls.

The northern façade is built of ashlar masonry and plain, topped with a simple cornice, with a simple undecorated gate covered with a semi-circular arch. The gateway leads to the courtyard. Over the gate is a marble calligraphic inscription panel recording the renovation in AH 1277 [= AD 1861] of the funerary enclosure of Lady Khadiga Khanum Brengi Qadim (see point 17). The undecorated rectangular windows are irregularly placed in the entrance façade. The rooms around the courtyard are nondescript, built of rubble stone and bricks, with undecorated facades pierced with plain rectangular windows with louvre shutters. At a certain point there was probably an upper storey over a part of the building, as there is a staircase in the north-eastern corner of the enclosure. There are thirteen tomb markers in the courtyard, some with elaborate calligraphic inscriptions in their shahid stelae. Many are recent, as young as 2017, with many modern inscription plaques added to apparently earlier tomb markers._x000D_
In one of the rooms by the eastern perimeter wall stands a decorated marble cenotaph dated to AH 1348 / AD 1929. In the room are stored marble pieces from other cenotaphs, including shahid stelae, one of a woman called Kalrab married to a man called Gentemkan (definitely not Arabic names), dated to AH 1282 (?)

(Khadiga is the name; khanum, brengi, and qadim are Ottoman honorific titles for women of high status in the ruling family.) The titles in the inscription, and the texts on cenotaphs in the enclosure clearly indicate that Lady Khadiga was a royal consort, the wife of Ibrahim Pasha. The inscription on a cenotaph dated AH 1348 / AD 1929 for Khadiga’s servant women indicates that Khadiga was a manumitted slave._x000D_
A shahid stela stored in the eastern burial chamber and dated to AH 1282(?) [=AD 1865] also commemorates a woman whose husband was in the service of Ibrahim Pasha._x000D_
The modern inscription plaques on the western annexe state that the person buried therein is Mustafa Basha, or Mustafa Bey Munir, who was the Great Yarawan to Ibrahim Pasha (a high Ottoman military post, an aide-de-camp), although at present, nothing inside relates to the name or suggests the date of 1848._x000D_
Ibrahim Pasha was the eldest son of Muhammad ‘Ali, the ruler of Egypt 1805-1848.

The entrance in the shorter wall of the rectangular shrine is from the east. The recessed entrance is topped by a simple, undecorated trefoil arch. There is a segmental relieving arch over the stone lintel of the main door, above which the name of the shaykh buried in the shrine and a date of his death have been recently rather crudely painted. The wooden door leaves have a simple decoration based on Classical motifs. The doorway leads into a double-height spacious burial chamber with windows in two levels (the lower-level ones cowered with semicircular arches and the large upper-level windows rectangular.)

The entrance portal is placed in the second recess from the north. The other recesses each contain a rectangular window with a massive stone lintel with a segmental relieving arch above. The windows are of very good quality of stonemasonry, but plain, undecorated. The entrance portal has a similar lintel and relieving arch framed in knotted mouldings, with a marble inscription panel above. The inscription in raised relief states that the funerary enclosure of the late ‘Abdu Bey al Babli and his family was renovated in AH 1371 / AD 1952. The door and window leaves are panelled and decorated with mafruka motifs. The portal is flanked by two small pointed-arched windows, possibly originally intended for distribution of water from a sabil. All windows have simple iron grilles. The portal leads to a gateway opening with a semicircular arch on an empty courtyard._x000D_
The burial chamber on the southern side of the courtyard is an arcade opening with three pointed arches of horseshoe profiles, framed in resting on simple knotted mouldings and resting on thick stone pillars. The interior is screened off with elaborate mashrabiya wooden screens set between the pillars, with the entrance door in the eastern bay. The interior is plain.

•	Art Deco-inspired decoration of the entrance doo","A slightly irregular, roughly rectangular walled enclosure with the entrance gate from the street placed approximately in the middle of the longer, eastern wall, the southern section ow which is hidden behind another enclosure. The façade is topped with a cavetto cornice decorated with lancet-shaped leafs possibly inspired by Pharaonic architecture, and a cable moulding. Over the cornice is a crenellation of geometric stylized palmette shapes. The entrance portal is taller than the rest of the front wall and flanked with two pilasters without capitals, with double mouldings intercrossing in a way vaguely resembling Mamluk knotted mouldings. The entrance door is placed in a recess topped with a slightly flattened (elliptical) arch and framed with a continuous torus moulding around the recess, with a palmette in the key. The door is framed by similar moulding forming engaged colonettes with extremely simplified vaguely floral geometric decoration on capitals. The tympanum of the arch is entirely filled with a marble slab bearing an inscription (see point 17 below). The double-leaf panelled wooden entrance door have carved decoration clearly inspired by Art Deco. There is a single window to the left of the portal and two windows to the right side, covered with segmental arches with huge console-like keystones with simplified floral decoration. The windows are filled with rather elaborate wrought iron grilles that bear no resemblance to Islamic art. The panelled window shutters are plain and undecorated._x000D_
Between the two windows to the right is a rectangular recess of a wall-fountain topped by a cornice similar to this on top of the façade, and with a cantilevered stone ledge at the bottom. Apparently it featured a decorated marble slab at the back, which is now missing._x000D_
The entrance leads to a platform placed between two simple, undecorated single-storey buildings in the south-eastern and north-eastern corners of the enclosure, separated by a wrought-iron railing from the funerary courtyard in the western part of the enclosure, which is four steps lower. The simple pattern of the fence is Art Nouveau- inspired. A similar fence encloses an empty section of the courtyard in the north-western corner, while by the northern perimeter wall is a raised platform with three limestone tomb markers. They were originally uninscribed, but are fitted with modern marble inscription plaques._x000D_
Asymmetrically placed within the enclosure is an elaborate uninscribed limestone cenotaph, with geometric decoration of simplified floral motifs. The cenotaph is surrounded by a wrought-iron fence of the pattern similar to the others in the enclosure and is covered by an openwork wrought iron canopy in a similar style.

•	Openwork stone window grille","A walled funerary enclosure of irregular plan, comprising disparate parts apparently in result of a long and complex history. The main entrance is in the long wall that faces the Sultan Ahmad Street, but is slightly oblique to its course, indicating that it may be older than the regular layout of the streets in the area. The marble panel over the door carries a two-lines calligraphic inscription in high relief including the name of Muhammad Effendi ‘Ali al-Darandli and the date AH 1324 (corresponding to AD 1906). The neo-Mamluk gateway is fully consistent with that date, similar to those found in other nearby monuments from the same period. The gateway section, crowned with a very elaborate fleur-de-lys crenelation, is much taller than the wall into which it is inserted, and is obviously later than the wall itself. That wall is of uniform construction with the salient part on the southern side: plain, undecorated, and crowned with a simple fleur-de-lys crenelation of rather crude execution. A window in the northern wall (external, street-facing) of the salient part is fitted with a simple openwork grille made of a limestone slab. A small openwork panel also cut in a limestone slab is set in the western wall to the right of the entrance gate. It is an arched opening with flanking colonettes and the spandrels open through. The slab is apparently in its original placement, as it is placed in a well-built through-the-wall opening covered with a stone lintel. An identical opening (with the openwork slab now missing) is placed symmetrically on the other side of the entrance gate. (Both openings are now at the street level, as the ground level rose with time.) A calligraphic marble panel on the wall dated AH 1324, i.e., clearly later than these architectural features, refers to drinking water, which suggests that these were possibly sabil windows. If this were the case, this would be a unique instance in Cairo of the sabil window in such a form. A large door or window right (south) of the entrance gate has been blocked with blocks of ashlar masonry._x000D_
The entrance portal is set in a shallow recess topped with a muqarnas frieze. In a typically Mamluk arrangement, the lintel of the gate (which is made of a monolithic block of marble) and the relieving arch above it are framed in knotted mouldings. The lunette of the relieving arch was filled with ceramic tiles (now missing). The huge wooden panelled door leaves are decorated with mafryka motifs._x000D_
South of the entrance gate, the rooms by the western wall of the enclosure and a walled courtyard have been recently unified into a modern single-storey building with walls clad in stone on the outside and lined with bricks on the inside. In the external south-western corner of this room, a decorated marble piece, apparently part of an Ottoman-period shahid stela is built into the crenellation._x000D_
In the courtyard stands an open-sided canopy of four semi-circular arches supported on octagonal stone columns with extremely simple, nearly formless Islamic-type capitals. The arches are bound with wooden tie-beams and carry a shallow dome (technically, a sail-vault) which on the outside is plastered to form a flat pyramidal roof. It appears that above the arches was originally either a cornice, or crenellation, now missing. The canopy is rather crudely built and undecorated. Under the canopy stands an undecorated, uninscribed whitewashed cenotaph in the form of an unarticulated lump of masonry. It is placed on a raised stone platform, which has been almost completely encased in a modern brick platform under the whole canopy, which also encased the bases and possibly pedestals of the columns. The visible part of the original dais under the cenotaph is a simple geometric frieze typical of late Ottoman architecture._x000D_
The southern part of the enclosure forms a separate rectangular courtyard with a modern wall of openwork brickwork with a simple iron gate between it and the rest of the enclosure. It has recently been partially covered with a shading roof of corrugated steel sheets on a steel structure. This section has a separate entrance from the street to the south._x000D_
The whole eastern wall of the enclosure (including the southern annexe) is built of large blocks of ashlar masonry and appears pre-modern, i.e., probably from the Ottoman period","The enclosure is used as a burial ground and maintained, although repairs and alterations have been insensitive to the historic value of the unit. The walls of the enclosure are damaged by rising damp. One of the stone grilles in the western façade is missing, the other is badly eroded by groundwater. Crenellations are incomplete. Ceramic tiles have been stolen from the lunette over the main entrance gate, apparently recently. The door leaves of the gate are severely damaged and incomplete.","The date 1324 AH in the inscription over the main gate corresponds to AD 1906. The gate is obviously inserted into an earlier wall. The stone details of the earlier façade appear to be Ottoman, not later than early 19th century. The domed canopy and the pedestal of the cenotaph under it are also apparently Ottoman, although the canopy may have been rebuilt.","For similar structures in the cemetery, compare Description de l’Egypte, Etat Moderne, Vol. I, Pl. 64, 65, 66.",20_P1150718s.jpg,,,,18th. c.; AD 1906; and later,20_DSC_5710s.JPG

The façade built of ashlar stone is very richly decorated in neo-Mamluk style. It uses motifs taken from Mamluk architecture, but combines them in innovative and unusual ways. The façade is tripartite, with a central portal section and side sections each with a single window in the ground floor and another on the upper floor. However, while the side sections are identically composed and decorated, they are of unequal width, the left side being considerably wider. Each of the three sections of the ground floor is flanked by flat pilasters which are aligned with the wall of the upper storey and therefore in the side sections of the ground floor level form shallow recesses that are covered with flat two-tiered muqarnas hoods. The full-height central section is slightly deeper recessed and on the upper level flanked by two massive pillars resting on muqarnas corbels and carrying a flat muqarnas hood interrupted by a pointed-arch niche in the middle. The side pillars are decorated with engaged corner colonnettes. The rectangular entrance door is topped with a typically Circassian Mamluk arrangement of a rectangular panel of knotted mouldings that frames the lintel and above it a flat arch of joggled voussoirs with the intrados forming a segmental relieving arch over the lintel. Above the door is a window framed with engaged corner colonnettes and topped with a shallow flat muqarnas hood, with two rectangular panels of geometrically treated floral motifs to the sides. Below and to the sides of the lower part of the window are panels of calligraphic inscriptions containing the opening sura of the Qur’an. The lintels over the entrance door and over the plain ground floor windows all have recessed panels of calligraphic inscriptions including the name of Hasan Mustafa (central panel) and date AH 1332 (left). The windows are fitted with decorative wrought-iron grilles in Art Nouveau style, unrelated to Mamluk tradition. The right one has larger arched openings at the bottom typical for a sabil, while the bottom openings in the left-side windows are also larger, but plain and not arched. The upper floor windows are topped with rectilinear keel-arch fluted flat niches. The façade is crowned with fleur-de-lys crenelations._x000D_
The door and all windows are fitted with decorative wooden panelled shutters including panels decorated with the “mafruqa” motifs (and on the upper floor, louvre panels), and clearly intended as an integral part of the decorated facade._x000D_
The entrance gate leads to a single space occupying the whole width of the building, and without a back wall, i.e. opening onto the back yard while the upper floor is entirely supported on two pillars, apparently wooden, but now covered in thick textured plaster like the rest of the courtyard. The upper floor continues along the western wall of the courtyard, and similarly overhangs a wide niche opened on the courtyard. An external staircase by the eastern wall of the courtyard leads to the gallery from which the rooms on the upper floor are accessed. The stairs are constructed of interlocking sections of segmental vaults built of flat limestone slabs, which was a method of construction consistently used in Cairo since the Mamluk times in at least 15th century. The stairs have a simple decorative wrought-iron balustrade in European style with no Islamic motifs._x000D_
In the plain back wall of the courtyard, an undecorated door leads to a vestibule separated on both sides from two burial chambers with full-height openwork wooden screens of geometric “mafruqa”-based motifs. The door to the vestibule is fitted with two decorative panelled wooden door-leaves._x000D_
The eastern chamber features a pointed-arch mihrab prayer niche very richly decorated with geometric motifs in stucco. Also in the eastern burial chamber is a richly carved marble cenotaph in the Ottoman Baroque style.","The ground level of the unit is in use and receives regular maintenance. However, the recent renovation that included application of thick textured plaster obscured or disfigured original features. The upper floor is disused and seriously dilapidated.

The neo-Mamluk façade of the main building is symmetrical and tripartite. The quality of stonemasonry is very high. The central part is taken by the entrance portal that is set in a full-height recess and includes all typical elements of a Circassian Mamluk porch such as this in the nearby mosques of Sultan Qaitbey (monument No 99, AD 1474) and Sultan Farag Ibn Barquq (No 149, 1400-11): a rectangular door flanked with “gals” (plural: galas) seats and topped with a lintel supported on muqarnas corbels to the sides, with a flat arch of joggled voussoirs with intrados forming a segmental relieving arch over the lintel; a recessed inscription band (in this case empty) to the sides (originally at about eye level); a rectangular small window above the door with a flat muqarnas hood; the crowning muqarnas hood; all framed in knotted mouldings. A marble plaque with an inscription in fina ruqa’ script in raised relief is set into the monolithic limestone lintel of the entrance door. The crowning hood is a combination of a flat muqarnas hood with a trilobe arrangement. The intertwining endings of the knotted mouldings over the entrance door are complex, angular, and closely-knit. This does not resemble Mamluk forms, but late Ottoman ones that kept in use well into the 19th century; it may therefore may represent a living architectural tradition rather than part of Mamluk Revival. A marble panel with a single-line calligraphic inscription stating the name of the deceased person and the date is inserted into a recess in the limestone door lintel. As the street level has risen considerably, the building is reached by a few steps leading down, and the side “gals” seats by the door have been rebuilt on a higher level, while the (empty) inscription band is now awkwardly low. _x000D_

The right-side one is a sabil window with larger openings at the bottom of the window grille and a stone ledge. The large rectangular upper floor windows are flanked with colonnettes with muqarnas capitals and topped with rectilinear keel-arch fluted flat niches. The façade is crowned with fleur-de-lys crenelations and terminates to the left with an engaged corner column with a muqarnas capital._x000D_

The entrance gate leads to a vestibule from which the rooms in the building are accessed, and from which a gate topped with a semi-circular arch leads to the courtyard to the south. At the eastern end of the courtyard stands a single-storey burial chamber. Like the rest of the courtyard and interior of the vestibule, it is covered with cement plaster with a crude imitation of stone courses. The façade of the mausoleum is tripartite, with the door placed between two windows. Over the openings are knotted-moulding frames that repeat those on the front façade, and covered with thick wash. Inside the frames are plain rectangles of plaster with very crudely and non-tectonically imitated stone courses. In the flat roof of the mausoleum is an octagonal lantern._x000D_

The straight part of the southern façade is tripartite, divided by simple rusticated pilasters with muqarnas corbels in place of capitals. The corbels carry stone blocks aligned with the course under the cornice on top of the wall and above an elaborate three-tiered muqarnas frieze. The frieze is therefore divided into sections that look like flat hoods of rectangular full-height recesses in which windows were typically placed in Mamluk-period mosques.

The main façade faces west and is composed of a tripartite elevation and a taller block of the entrance portal attached to it to the left (north) and slightly protruding. The portal is set in a deep recess covered with a flat muqarnas hood topped with a pointed-arch niche. It includes all typical elements of a Circassian Mamluk porch such as this in the nearby mosques of Sultan Qaitbey (monument No 99, AD 1474) and Sultan Farag Ibn Barquq (No 149, 1400-11): a rectangular door flanked with “gals” (plural: galas) seats and topped with a lintel framed with mouldings, with a flat arch of joggled voussoirs with intrados forming a segmental relieving arch over the lintel; a recessed inscription band (in this case empty) to the sides at about eye level; a rectangular small window above the door with a flat muqarnas hood; the crowning muqarnas hood; all framed in knotted mouldings. To the sides of the window in the entrance recess are two sunken square panels: the left one contains a plain uninscribed marble slab, from the one to the right the marble has been recently stolen as evidenced by fresh marks from prying off. The façade to the right looks much like an external façade of the qibla (Mecca-facing) wall of a Mamluk madrasa/mosque although it is the opposite, western wall. As would be the case in a Mamluk building, the double-level fenestration belies the single full-height interior. In the lower level is a large window topped with a typically Circassian Mamluk arrangement of a rectangular panel of knotted mouldings that frames the lintel and above it a flat arch of stepped voussoirs with the intrados forming a segmental relieving arch over the lintel. It is placed in a slightly protruding section of the wall and placed in a full-height recess in it, topped with an elaborate flat muqarnas hood. Over the ground floor window is a plain round window. Also in the upper level, to each side of the protruding section is a rectangular window with a rectilinear keel-arch flat niche decorated conch-like with three tiers of angular recesses. Such form is typical of windows on internal walls in the central courtyard of Circassian Mamluk-period madrasa/mosque (such as in Sultan Qaitbey’s, No 99), but not used externally. The south-western corners of both units that comprise the building are decorated with engaged corner columns with elaborate muqarnas capitals. Windows on side and back walls have the typically Mamluk arrangement, but the framings are not carved into knotted mouldings, but left plain._x000D_
The interior of the larger space would constitute a sizeable prayer hall if it was roofed. There is a huge and elaborate mihrab prayer niche flanked by colonettes with muqarnas capitals and with a fluted conch in the crowning pointed-arch niche. The two square pillars in the room and corresponding engaged pillars in the walls indicate that the space was designed to be divided into two aisles of three bays each, but it appears that the roof was never constructed. There are more indications that the building was never completed. Some interior walls are built of rough stone which was apparently designed to be covered with plaster, but has been left exposed. All windows are bricked up, with no indication that any windows, window grilles, or shutters were ever installed. There is not a single inscription on the building, the mouldings around side and back windows are apparently unfinished, as are two plain square panels on the front façade.","The walls are in sound condition, but the building is disused and unroofed.

Above the door is a small calligraphic panel with name of the deceased and date. To the left is an undecorated rectangular window, and to the right, a very low secondary door with a simple wrought-iron grille in the upper part. The upper storey is plastered, with divisions into huge square panels marked by incised lines in the plaster, and features a rectangular projection over the entrance gate with windows on three sides.

There is a band of Qur’anic inscriptions painted around the walls at breast height in bold calligraphic lettering._x000D_
Also from the vestibule are accessible: a secondary burial chamber; a service room; and a staircase in the south-western corner. The stairs are constructed of interlocking sections of segmental vaults built of flat limestone slabs, which is a method of construction consistently used in Cairo since the Mamluk times in at least 15th century.

The door is set in an extremely simplified rusticated framing and has a flat arch of joggled voussoirs as a lintel, as does the front façade window. A secondary door in the northern elevation leads to an external pergola (now missing any cover) on massive wooden beams resting on two stone pillars. Within the pergola are two simple limestone tomb markers, while more apparently related cenotaphs, some with fine calligraphic inscriptions, are located around the building. The main doorway leads into a vestibule from which are accessible: a service area with a toilet and a kitchenette; the burial chamber containing a wooden cenotaph of Rifa’a al-Tahtawi covered in a green cloth; and a second burial chamber preceded by an internal sitting area with numerous marble inscription panels commemorating persons deceased in the second half of the 20th century mounted on the western wall, as well as piece of cloth in the shape of the traditional Egyptian ""galabeya"" dress, with the names of Rifa'a al-Tahtawi and his family and the dates of their deaths embroidered. To the north of the room is a chamber with two large marble cenotaphs decorated with inscription panels dedicated to the female members of the family, those married to Al-Tahtawi sons.

Coming from a rural background, he was educated as a religious scholar at the al-Azhar University. He then went in 1826-1831 to Paris to study a broad range of subjects. Upon his return, he held different positions serving Muhammad ‘Ali’s and his descendants’ governments, including the director of the School of Languages that he established for the training of professional translators. He also translated himself numerous important works on medicine, geography, military arts, history, literature, politics, and jurisprudence (including translating the French Civil Code.) He wrote and published his own works on the subjects of European political institutions, the need for enlightened education (including education of girls), and on the public interest and public good.","•	Vatikiotis, P.

The building is well constructed of ashlar masonry blocks with edges rebated to accentuate the joints. The entrance gate in the north-facing façade inside the porch is asymmetrically placed, with two rectangular windows with rusticated flat arches as lintels to the right and one to the left. The windows in the courtyard-facing facades are identical. All are fitted with simple louvre shutters. The window to the left of the gate in the front façade is a sabil window with a rounded marble ledge decorated with floral scrolls under a moulding. The arched gate has a simple rusticated architectural framing and a double-leaved door with neo-classical based decorative panelling. In the entablature over the gate is a rectangular marble ainscription panel with eight calligraphic framed compartments. Over the cornice, there is a semi-circular marble inscription panel divided into nine calligraphic compartments. The gate leads to a vestibule that gives access to the sabil room to the left, the burial chamber to the right, and to two residential rooms at the back. The burial chamber contains a single marble cenotaph elaborately decorated in the Ottoman Baroque style. The chamber has a ceiling of exposed bevelled beams, painted green, red, and pea-green and featuring a simple decorative wooden frieze at the top of the walls._x000D_
The wooden front porch has in the front elevation four round arches supported on five massive wooden columns, and in each side elevation a similar round arch and a narrower pointed arch. The tympana of the arches and the rectangular horizontal openings above them are filled with very elaborate wooden openwork of geometric patterns with floral motifs. The overhanging roof has a very elaborate tassellated wooden edge. Atop the corners of the main building are decorative stone vases. The ones at the front are awkwardly hidden behind the wooden porch, suggesting that it may be a later addition or an afterthought during construction.","The unit is in fair overall condition, although dilapidated. The wooden openwork decoration of the porch is heavily damaged and partially missing. The north-western corner column of the porch is missing, apparently knocked down by a vehicle moving on the street that sometimes becomes busy. The photograph in Al-Kady and Bonnamy’s book published in 2007 (p.197) shows that this happened before that date.","According to a resident, the enclosure currently belongs to Ahmad Mandur family, who also own the nearby funerary enclosure of al-‘Abd al-Fakir Muhammad (No 29 in this survey). Ahmed Mandur is reported to have worked for the original Turkish family who had owned the enclosures before._x000D_
Al-Kadi and Bonnamy (p.197) attribute the tomb to Salih Pasha Silim and date it to AD 1910 without quoting any evidence. Judging by the style of the building, the date 1910 is not improbable. The name of Mustafa Pasha al Khazindar appears in the inscription on the semi-circular marble panel over the entrance door. Khazindar means “treasurer”, and is also a given name of Turkish origin deriving from this title.","•	El Kadi, Galila and Bonnamy, Alain Architecture for The Dead: Cairo's Medieval Necropolis, American University in Cairo Press 2007, p. 197.",28_DSC_5333s.JPG,,,,AD 1910 [?],28_1150742.jpg

The arched entrance gate in the middle of the western façade has a very simple neo-classical based architectural framing and simply decorated wooden door-leaves (with most decoration apparently missing.) The section of the western perimeter wall north (left) of the entrance gate forms a symmetrical façade which is a water-distributing section of the unit. It has two large rectangular windows with simple sabil-type iron grilles (i.e., with larger arched openings at the bottom) and protruding rounded moulded marble ledges. Between the windows is a wall water-fountain (çeshme) with a metal tap (now missing) set in a marble panel with a calligraphic inscription. Over the wall-fountain is a marble panel with semi-circular sides recessed within a thick moulding and containing eight calligraphic compartments including the name of the founder. Both calligraphic panels include the date 1311 AH and a very elaborate signature of the calligrapher. To the right (south) of the entrance gate, the wall transitions to a lower southern section with a rounded section of the moulding, in a manner typical for mid-19th century Ottoman-style buildings in Cairo, such as the nearby tomb of Sulayman Pasha al-Silahdar of 1858 (El Kadi and Bonnamy, 200-4.) _x000D_
A simple single-storied residential building is placed by the eastern perimeter wall (now bordering of a tall residential building.) It has a very simple neo-classical based entrance gate asymmetrically placed, with three undecorated rectangular windows to the left and one to the right._x000D_
The northern side of the enclosure forms an outdoor burial area raised by one step and arranged as a garden. It is partially shaded by a wooden pergola and is separated from the courtyard in front of the residential building by a railing of wooden balusters with an entrance in the centre flanked by stone pillars. It contains four undecorated stone cenotaphs (currently rendered shapeless by crude cement rendering.) There is no building behind the sabil windows in the western wall of this section, and apparently there never was one. Two large windows in the northern perimeter wall (now blocked) originally opened onto the street to the north.","The unit is in fair overall condition, although there is severe damage to the masonry of the western façade due to raising damp.

The main gate placed in the middle of the northern wall and built of well-dressed stone is a simple classical-based doorway covered with a semicircular arch flanked by two flat Tuscan pilasters carrying a very simplified entablature. The secondary entrance in the middle of the eastern façade is a simple door covered with a semicircular arch. The gates, corners, and vertical bands dividing the walls into sections are built of dressed stone, the walls between them are plastered, as are the walls of the courtyard.

In the spacious courtyard are numerous (over twenty) simple masonry mastabas without shahid stelas typical of Muslim tomb markers. Carved marble panels apparently from dismantled cenotaphs are mounted on the S wall of the main building, and some shahids lay on the mastabas. (See section 17). A marble wall-fountain in Ottoman Baroque style, apparently transferred from elsewhere, is also mounted on the wall next to the entrance to the main building._x000D_
By the western wall of the enclosure, a straight flight of stone stairs leads from the northern side to a subterranean barrel-vaulted corridor of stone masonry, with walled-up doors leading to burial crypts. The passage is lit by a large square light-shaft, over which stands a pergola of wood on stone piers._x000D_
The entrance to main building on the N side of the courtyard is shaded by an elaborate wooden eave on decorative wooden brackets. The door-leaves are of high-quality elaborate geometric paneling, with elaborate brass fittings decorated with floral scrolls and inscriptions. The door leads to a square entrance hall at the W end of the building. This sitting room (equipped with armchairs) is decorated with stucco panels of elaborate arabesque floral scrolls in knotted mouldings frames and a band of stucco floral scrolls around the walls at breast-heighth. On the western wall is a long rectangular panel of Ottoman-style ceramic tiles framed in knotted mouldings and framed by two similar square panels. In the northern wall is a square window with a mashrabiya grille in the mafruka form. The entrance hall is covered with a very elaborate wooden ceiling, with “stalactite” coffers, geometric decoration and an inscription band in the frieze.  _x000D_
The entrance hall opens with a wide opening on the central domed chamber, which it adjoins via a simple narrow room. The dome rests on four pointed arches, two of which open onto the side rooms. The drum is pierced with four windows with qamariyat grilles. The dome interior and drum are richly painted in elaborate colourful geometric patterns. A Kufic inscription band runs around the drum. Internally, the zone –of-transition is formed by two plain triangular planes set at an angle in each corner. Under the dome is a low dais, square in plan and clad with stone tiles, on which lay four plain marble slabs with names (but no dates or other information) in incised calligraphic script._x000D_
To the east of the domed chamber is a room separated from it by a wooden mashrabiya screen. The walls of the room are decorated with stucco panels similar to those in the western hall. The windows covered with semi-circular arches are fitted with qamariyat gypsum-and-stained-glass grilles._x000D_
External façades are covered with plaster, with windows and blind niches set in rectangular recesses covered with muqarnas friezes, and with elaborate arabesque stucco panels beneath. The recesses are placed sparsely and asymmetrically. The entrance is to the side of the façade. The mausoleum is thus one of the few at the cemetery that does not employ Mamluk-style motifs on a strictly symmetrical Beaux-Arts design._x000D_
The reinforced-concrete shell of the dome is covered on the outside with fluted ribs in plaster, overhanging on stalactite corbels and giving the dome a slightly “onion” profile (a form of Persian origin, found sometimes in Mamluk architecture in Cairo: in mausoleums al-Sultaniya [No 288], of Sargatmish [No 218], and of Yunis al-Dawadar [No 139]). The crenellations on the façade are of zigzag-profile form typical of Ayyubid and early Mamluk architecture in Cairo, rather than the late-Mamluk form more typical of the cemetery.","The enclosure is in generally good condition, but shows signs of wear-out. Big part of the plaster fluted decoration on the concrete dome is missing. Damage to cornices and upper parts of walls suggests rainwater penetration through inadequate roof cover._x000D_
According to the property keeper, the funerary enclosure is at high risk of partial demolition and he was notified about the removal of half the dome. (The property is located close to the Salah Salem freeway and susceptible to destruction in case of its planned widening / doubling.)","Abu Bakr Ratib Pasha was a previous minister of Military Production as well as the governor of Alexandria and the head of the parliament twice: in 1871 and 1873.

The earliest date found in the enclosure (on a broken marble tomb marker) is AH 1291 [corresponds to AD 1874]. The present mausoleum is definitely later, dating to the first half of the 20th century and probably as late as 1940s, judging from both stylistic features and use of reinforced concrete in construction.

A mezzanine of two small low-ceiling storage rooms is accessed from the staircase landing. The upper floor is a residential apartment consisting of a kitchen, a toilet and a bedroom with a doorway leading into a spacious roof overlooking the courtyard._x000D_
In the shaded burial area are six carved marble cenotaphs, some with multiple shahid stelae. The earliest date is this of Ahmad Bey Raghib’s death: 25 Shawwal 1302 AH [corresponding to 6 August AD 1885]. Other dates are mostly from the 1910s, the latest is 1925. Some of the shahid stelae are highly unusual in representing men’s torsos in naturalistically depicted clothing, complete with lapels, bowties and pocket watches on watch chains. There is also one uninscribed limestone cenotaph inside the courtyard._x000D_
The neo-Mamluk entrance portal of finely dressed ashlar stone is in the north-western corner of the enclosure, the rest of the eastern wall being blocked by the neighbouring funerary enclosure. The rectangular entrance door is set in a shallow full-height recess topped with a three-tiered muqanas frieze. The door lintel is a monolithic block of marble with an inscription panel in fine calligraphic script, signed by the calligrapher Ahmad Yusuf and dated AH 1314. Over the door is a segmental relieving arch with white-and-blue ceramic tiles in its lunette, and above it, a rectangular panel with the foundation inscription. The Mamluk-style fleur-de-lys crenellation over the portal does not continue over the perimeter wall built of rough stone._x000D_
In front of the gate and against the wall of the neighbouring enclosure stands a sabil, which is a wooden cupboard-like structure on a simple marble base. The walls of the sabil are geometric panels of very high quality of design and of joinery. Over the door is an imitation in wooden panels of a relieving arch of joggled voissoirs. The inscription panel over the sabil door is dated AH 1347 [corresponds to AD 1928).","The enclosure is in generally good condition, but shows signs of wear-out. There is damage from rising damp to the lower parts of the walls. All woodwork is in need of maintenance.

Abuts on neighbouring enclosures from the southern and western sides. The ground floor was originally an open-sided funerary enclosure, over which a residential unit was elevated on square pillars of stonemasonry. The entrance is from the left (southern) side of the eastern elevation. It leads through a gate with the door topped by a semi-circular arch and framed in simple pilasters and simplified entablature to a staircase giving access to the upper floor. The stairs are of the construction that in Cairo dates back to at least Mamluk times: consisting of flat arches of thin limestone slab, over which a filling of lime mortar forms the steps that are lined with limestone slabs. The result is a monolithic unit that works like concrete. There is a simple limestone cenotaph in the staircase. To the south or the staircase is a room with a sabil window in the eastern elevation left of the gate, fitted with a simple decorative wrought-iron grille. A marble inscription panel in raised relief is set above the window. It includes the date 1313 AH. The calligraphic inscription are six stanzas of poetic verse._x000D_

It is hemmed in between neighbouring enclosures, with access only from narrow pedestrian streets. There are 13 rooms by the perimeter walls, taking up most of the lot. The earliest part of the complex appears to be the enclosure in its northern part, measuring approximately 22 x 15 m in plan, with rooms grouped in a U-shape around the courtyard by the eastern wall, with a small secondary courtyard by the western wall in the southern tract of the rooms. The main entrance is in the northern façade, which is built of rubble stone and plastered, and is undecorated save the huge cavetto cornice at the top of the wall, which transitions in a smooth curve from the taller eastern section and the lower western section. There are five undecorated rectangular windows in the façade, with simple iron grilles and simple wooden panelled shutters. The gate topped with a semi-circular arch is built of ashlar stone and undecorated. It leads to a hallway in a residential section with two rooms currently occupied by the keepers. The hallway leads to a courtyard (now used for raising poultry), from which a large square burial chamber on the southern side of the courtyard is accessed. It has an octagonal wooden lantern in its plain, undecorated ceiling, and contains two decorated marble cenotaphs and two decorated limestone tomb markers. Another burial room in this zone has a partially broken ceiling and includes a richly decorated marble cenotaph. There is a small courtyard south of the main burial chamber, and west of it, a plain room which according to a panel on the wall is a shrine to Muhammad Abdelghani, the Shaykh of the Sufi group al-Bayyumiya. The Shaykh’s wooden cenotaph covered with cloth stands inside an extremely simple wooden enclosure. Further south, around two tiny courtyards, are six more plain and undecorated burial rooms, which are in very poor condition, some of them inaccessible due to collapsed rooves.","The northern part of the complex, maintained by the keepers who live there, is in fair structural condition.

Its current form evidently results from numerous restorations and remodelling. There is no formal façade and the arrangement of the interior is haphazard. The entrance (western) façade built of rather roughly dressed ashlar stone is accessible from a narrow lane that is entered through a maze of open funerary enclosures and access lanes. It is built of rather roughly dressed ashlar stone; the workmanship appears typical of the Ottoman period. The entrance gate is in the left (northern) part of the façade. It is a wide rectangular door set in a very shallow projection topped with a simple cornice and fleur-de-lys crenellation. The door is covered with a flat arch of joggled voussoirs. The openwork steel door-leaves are modern. Farther south are two plain irregularly placed windows fitted with simple wrought iron grilles. At the far southern end of the façade is a door covered with a semi-circular arch. It leads to a narrow passage to a courtyard by the southern wall, which apparently was partly taken up by the enlargement of the neighbouring enclosure of al Baqli Family presumably in the early 20th century._x000D_
Internally, the roof is supported on an assortment of various irregularly placed columns and pillars: three square and one round pillars of stone and two of wood.  There is skylight in the middle of the southern part of the structure where the roof cover over the roofing beams is replaced with a very simple trellis; the section in the north-western corner of the interior is taller, forming a clerestory of six simple windows.  By the eastern wall are two open-fronted rooms screened off with simple decorative wooden screens. The southern one features an octagonal roof lantern covered with a pointed roof. In the roof over the eastern section of the building are also two small “malqaf” wind-catchers. There are service rooms: a kitchen and a toilet in the south-eastern corner._x000D_
Irregularly placed within the interior are tomb markers, three of which are huge mastabas built of limestone, with arched openings in the lower parts and with edges and corners decorated with knotted mouldings of typically Otttoman angular profiles. On the two placed by the southern wall stand elaborately carved marble cenotaphs, and on the largest one under the skylight stand two cenotaphs. The other tomb markers are simple stepped structures of limestone. All carry shahid stelae, sometimes in sets of three, some of them topped with turban and other headgear ornaments. Some stelae are flat, other square or octagonal in sections. The quality of workmanship varies, but some calligraphic inscriptions in raised relief are of very high quality. The oldest are dated to 1443 and 1455 AH [corresponding to AD 1731 and 1742]. The other cenotaphs are apparently later, with one bearing the date AH 1270 [1854] and the enclosure has been used for burials up to the modern times, as attested by recent commemorative marble plaques, one dating from AH 1445 / AD 2022._x000D_

At present there is no recognisable enclosure associated with the mausoleum. The structure measures only about 4.5 x 4.5 metres in plan. The mausoleum consists of a burial chamber built of ashlar masonry covered with a brick dome. The brick-built zone of transition consists of three simple steps, with rectilinear keel-arched windows in a “honeycomb” one-over-two arrangement (albeit the recesses in which they are placed are pointed-arched.) The sixteen-sided drum is pierced with windows alternating with blind niches. The dome is fluted with ribs of alternating width. All these features resemble very closely those of nearby early-Mamluk mausolea (e.g., of Ibn Ghurab, monument No 96, ca. 1405, of Anas, No 157, 1382)._x000D_
Currently, the entrance is in the eastern part of the northern façade and is obviously non-original, with the door inserted into a breach in the wall. The original entrance which should be expected to be in the western (or possibly southern) façade has apparently been blocked when the walls of the neighbouring enclosures were built. In the eastern wall is a buttress-like projection that contains the mihrab niche in the interior (similar features are commonly found in Mamluk-period architecture, e.g. the mosque of Farag Ibn Barquq: monument No 149, 1400-1411), and a rectangular window fitted with openwork limestone grille of geometric pattern design framed in knotted moulding._x000D_
Inside, the mihrab niche is highly unusually placed off-centre in the qibla wall, with the single window left of it. The mihrab is framed with knotted mouldings of typically Ottoman-period angular and densely knotted form. The spandrels of the arch are decorated with protruding medallions framed by star-like patterns. The quality of craftsmanship is mediocre. A huge semicircular arch spans the whole southern wall internally, possibly indicating the position of the original entrance door._x000D_
Internally, the zone of transition under the dome is composed of three tiers of muqarnas. The dome is covered inside with plain plaster.",The overall condition of the mausoleum is poor. The building is buried deep in rubble and refuse that also fills the interior. The walls are damaged by rising damp. There are some cracks in the dome. The window frames and sashes are missing. There are recent crude repairs with cement where stone blocks are missing near the current entrance door.,"The building techniques and the style of decoration clearly point at the Ottoman-period date.

By the western side of the courtyard is a nondescript added room built of brick. On the southern side of the courtyard is a pergola of six stone pillars with muqarnas capitals, with wooden tie-beams. The pergola is roofless and appears to have never been completed. It is separated from the courtyard with an elaborate wrought-iron railing the Art Nouveau (not Islamic) style. In the western section of the pergola stands a very elaborately carved marble cenotaph. The floral decoration of the cenotaph is enhanced with painting in bright green and purple. The entrance to the courtyard is through a hallway with the floor of decorative cement tiles, originally opening onto the courtyard with a huge opening with a semi-circular arch (upper part now walled up to form a rectangular door.)_x000D_

All windows have decorative grilles of Islamic geometric patterns that are welded from flat pieces of rolled steel. The lower parts of the sabil windows are cast in bronze, with fine detailing (the norther one now completely invisible, the southern one partially obscured._x000D_
All recesses in the façade have on their sides plain square blocks of stone on bottom and top, clearly indicating that the recesses were intended to be flanked with columns. The window recesses are open at the top, without any muqarnas frieze or moulding; there is no cornice on the top of the façade, and no traces of any crenellations. All this, together with the apparently unfinished pergola in the courtyard, strongly indicates that the building was never fully completed as originally planned.","The overall structural condition is fair, but the building is worn by continued residential use.

The front building comprises an entrance hall without a back wall (i.e., with its back side opened onto the courtyard), and two rooms to its sides. The front wall of the entrance hall is much taller than the rest of the façade and built of ashlar masonry, while the other walls are built of rough stone. The entrance door is set in a recess covered with an undecorated trefoil arch with the central lobe much narrower than the side ones and of a round profile rather than pointed. The rectangular gate has its monolithic stone lintel and the relieving arch of stepped-joggled voussoirs above it framed in an undecorated projecting rectangular band – either an extreme simplification of Mamluk architectural form, or evidence that the construction was not completed.

The complex consists of a set of rooms on the western side accessible from a gate in the southern façade, a room on the northern side that contains a sabil in the rounded south-eastern corner and is accessible from a gate in the eastern façade, and a small square courtyard between them. There are remnants of a wooden roof with a skylight over the courtyard that serves as a burial ground and contains a carved marble cenotaph. The eastern façade is built entirely of ashlar stone. In the southern and western façades the base courses, the cornice, the flat pilasters, and the south-western corner are built of ashlar stone, while the rest of the walls are built of rough stone and plastered. In the eastern façade, the entrance portal placed to the right (north) is placed in a shallow recess topped with an elaborate muqarnas frieze and framed in knotted mouldings. The rectangular door is covered with a lintel formed by a flat arch of step-joggled voussoirs with a placement for an inscription panel (now empty) framed on moulding. Over the door is a small rectangular window flanked with colonnetes, with a muqarnas frieze carved in its lintel. The window and the lintel of the door are framed in knotted mouldings. Left of the portal is a shallow recess topped with an elaborate muqarnas frieze, with a single large rectangular window. The southern façade is divided into four sections of unequal width. The eastern and western sections each contain a single rectangular window. The second section from west is built entirely of ashlar stone and is a portal similar to this in the eastern façade, only without a placement of an inscription panel over the door. The portal leads to an entrance hall from which the western room and the burial chamber are accessed. The middle section right of the portal contains two windows corresponding to the burial chamber (now a roofless courtyard.) The western façade has two identical windows.

A narrow alley to the east has been filled with utilitarian structures. The complex has an axial layout and consists of (1) a free-standing domed mausoleum located on the main axis close to the eastern perimeter wall; (2) The main gateway in the middle of the western façade of the enclosure; (3) two generally L-shaped buildings on either side of the gateway occupying the north-western and south-western corners of the enclosure; (4) A simple service building by the southern perimeter wall of the enclosure and a simple shed of reinforced concrete in the north-eastern corner in the enclosure. The huge open courtyard is sparsely planted with greenery, with an alleyway from the gateway to the mausoleum, and with a paved burial area in the south-eastern corner, in which stands a single limestone tomb-marker._x000D_
(1) The strictly axially planned mausoleum is built of ashlar stone masonry and consists of a central domed section and two flat-roofed annexes located on the northern and southern sides. Each of the three units has an entrance door on the western side. The square under the central dome rests on stone pillars and opens on all four sides onto narrow side rooms with wide horseshoe arches carried on marble columns. Over the arches runs a carved inscription band, and the spandrels are filled with arabesque floral motifs with calligraphic medallions. The side rooms are covered with flat ceilings painted in geometric patterns imitating coffering. In the corners, the four intersections of the narrow outer rooms are covered with small domes on pendentives. The walls of the small domed rooms are pierced with tall, narrow windows with qamariyat grilles. The central dome rests on four tiers of muqarnases in the corners, with triple keel arch windows in the zone of transition, with qamariyat gypsum-and-stained-glass windows. The drum is pieced with twelve keel-arched windows; the interior of the dome is plain. In the qibla wall is a mihrab niche flanked with marble columns. The mihrab is set in a rectangular frame of knotted mouldings, the upper part of which is filled with floral arabesque. Over the mihrab is a huge carved medallion, also with floral arabesque. The side annexes are reparated from the central section by round arches resting on double marble columns by the walls; the upper parts of the arches are filled with flat fluted conchs, and below them, a carved panel with elaborate “stalactite” forms protruding into the opening. In the whole interior, the elaborate, high-quality decoration carved in stone has a decidedly Andalusian flavour._x000D_
In the side annexes, there are triple keel-arched windows with qamariyat grilles. The ceilings of the annexes are flat slabs of reinforced concrete, with painted decoration of colourful geometric patterns. The walls are plastered, with a painted dado imitating wooden panelling._x000D_
On the exterior, the entrance portal is set in a recess flanked with marble columns and topped with a fluted conch sitting on rows of muqarnases. The wooden door is fitted with elaborate bronze borders and a central rosette of floral and geometric patterns. The tympanum of the keel arch above the door contains a calligraphic inscription in stucco on a pale blue mosaic background (see section “History”)._x000D_
The doors of the side annexes have elaborate wooden joinery panelling in complex geometric patterns. In the keel arches over the doors are windows made of thin alabaster slabs. The drum of the dome is covered with floral arabesque patterns; the dome is ribbed, the ribs themselves fluted and separated by moulding-framed recesses. The ribbing overhanging over the drum and a markedly concave upper section give the dome a slightly “onion bulb” profile distinctly different from the Mamluk-period ones in the area. The building is topped with very simplified crenellations, with prominent “pomegranate” decorations on all corners. The interior floor is raised about a metre, so there marble steps in front of the doors._x000D_
(2) The entrance gate, built of ashlar stone masonry, is much taller than the rest of the façade of the enclosure. The huge entrance door is covered with a massive marble lintel (composed of three pieces, so technically, a flat arch) bearing inscription with the name of Ibrahim Pasha Halim in Kufic script over floral scrolls background. The door is set in a recess with an elaborate muqarnas frieze above the lintel, and over it, a scalloped pointed arch with the tympanum filled with floral arabesque motifs and pierced with a double keel-arched window. The portal is set within a frame of arabesque bands and a denticulated cornice with simplified crenellations above. At the base of this framing are panels with elaborate carved arabesque medallions. On the inside, the gateway through a very thick wall is covered with a segmental arch. Over the arch is a gallery opened onto the courtyard with an arcade of five keel-arches resting on four slender marble columns. The gallery is accessible from the roofs of the buildings on either side of the gate._x000D_
(3) The courtyard-facing walls of the buildings to the sides of the gate are constructed of rubble stone and plastered, with simple, undecorated rectangular door and windows openings. The windows are fitted with simple louvre shutters. There are raised terraces with openwork stone balustrades in front of the eastern walls i.e. to the sides of the gate._x000D_
_x000D_
The external front (western) façade of the enclosure is built of ashlar stone, topped with simplified crenellations, and divided on each side of the gate into three sections with simple stripes of masonry framing rectangular shallow recesses with one window in each. The windows are without architectural framing, topped with keel arches and fitted with simple decorative shutters with mafruqa pattern and small openings in the panelling. At the far southern (right) end of the façade, in the fourth section is a large gate with a wide wooden door and mashrabiya screen in the keel arch above it. Apparently, this was the garage for the vehicles of visitors. There is an engaged corner column in the south-western corner. The corresponding section at the northers (left) end of the façade is taken by a huge round-fronted sabil in the north-western corner of the enclosure, with three windows._x000D_

The neo-Mamluk entrance façade is built of ashlar stone; the craftsmanship is of high quality. Its southern part is tripartite and strictly axial. In the middle is the entrance portal set in a recess covered with elaborate three-tiered muqarnas frieze with muqarnases of “stalactite” forms. In a typically Mamluk-style arrangement, the monolithic limestone lintel over the door and the relieving arch above it, which is built of simple step-joggled voussoirs, are framed in knotted mouldings. There is no room for a window or an inscription panel over the door and below the muqarnas frieze. The wooden door-leaves with decorative panelling do not relate to Islamic patterns. On either side of the portal is a shallow rectangular recess covered with a simple muqarnas frieze and containing a window with the lintel and the relieving arch above it framed in simple (not knotted) moulding of Mamluk-style profile. The portion of the façade north of the tripartite section is plain, pierced with a smaller, simple rectangular window with a simple moulding around it. The façade is topped with a simple, Mamluk-profile cornice and fleur-de-lys crenellations, which are preserved only in the northern part of the façade. The southern façade has recently been completely refaced with stone cladding that obscured the original engaged slender column in the south-western corner.

Apparently quite recently it has undergone a renovation programme that included rebuilding or re-facing of many tomb markers, rearranging of inscription plaques and new paving in cement tiles.","The title katkhuda mustahfizan in Ottoman Egypt signified the commander of the members of the janissary corps, who were locally called mustahfizan, meaning “guardians” [of the gates to the Northern Enclosure in the Citadel of Cairo, where they were stationed.] This was a very high position in the power structure of the Beylicate, a group of high military officers who by the eighteen century were often the effective rulers of Egypt.

The design is closely based on Burgi-period Mamluk ones, of which excellent examples are preserved nearby. The decoration is Mamluk-inspired, but simplified into basic geometric forms. Currently, the structure comprises a square domed burial chamber entered from the south and a lower rectangular annexe to its northern side. Originally, there were more rooms and arcades. Externally, there is a single deep recess in each façade, covered with a flat hood of three rows of extremely simplified muqarnases. Originally, there were four ground-level openings in the burial chamber: the entrance door on the southern side (door now replaced), tall rectangular doors opening onto no longer extant arcaded spaces on the east and west sides, fitted with steel grilles of geometric star patterns (the eastern one now fully and the western one partially walled up), and a wide pointed-arch opening to the northern annexe. The rectangular upper row windows, identical in each façade, are set in recesses of simplified rectangular forms and are fitted with bronze grilles similar to those in Mamluk-period windows._x000D_
The zone of transition under the dome features Mamluk-style elaborate bold mouldings in the corners and is pierces on each side with typically Mamluk arrangement of oculi and round-arched windows in a one-over-two-over-three pattern. The windows are framed with knotted mouldings. The plain drum is pierced with twelve undecorated round-arched windows, and the dome is decorated with herringbone zigzag pattern (similar to this in the neighbouring dome of Amir Kebir Qurqumas (1507) and originating in the domes of nearby monument of Farag Ibn Barquq (1400-11). The dome is surmounted by a very tall brass crescent finial Taller than in Hasan Fathi’s original design drawings (see point 17, “references”, 1)._x000D_
Internally, the openings in the walls of the mausoleum are set in rectangular recesses topped with simplified muqarnas friezes that are flanked by tall slender semi-circular niches topped with simple semi-domes. The side doors have calligraphically inscribed lintels and arabesque patterns on the relieving arches above them. An inscription band runs around the upper part of the burial chamber. The lower parts of the walls are covered with a simple marble dado with a simple geometric frieze at the top. The zone-of-transition below the dome is formed by five rows of simplified muqarnases. In the middle of the burial chamber stands a huge marble cenotaph decorated with simple Islamic art-inspired motifs including calligraphic inscription panels on its sides. The cenotaph is surmounted with an oversized “pomegranate” bulb on a moulded pedestal.","The extant structure is in good structural condition, although it shows signs of inadequate maintenance: peeling paint, soiled wall surfaces, the floor and cenotaphs covered with birds’ droppings, haphazardly blocked openings._x000D_
The existing mausoleum is only a part of an originally larger layout. Physical evidence on site shows that at least parts or the original design were was not only originally planned, but actually constructed and then partly destroyed. The original complex was laid out on a lot measuring 62 metres from north to south and with the eastern border slanting, so the lot tapered from 32.6 meters on the north to 16 metres on the south. The mausoleum located in the northern part of the lot was accessed from an elevated terrace with arcades of five arches on each side. The openings in the eastern and western sides of the mausoleum and its northern annexe led to L-shaped rooms wrapping around small square courtyards attached to the mausoleum, with arcades on three columns to two sides. The entrance to the complex was through a neo-Mamluk portal in the southern side of the western wall of the enclosure. It led to a vestibule covered with two domes that was located in a building occupying the southern side of the lot. The building also included a sabil in the form of a loggia with two openings in the southern façade, a guard’s room and sanitary service facilities. The space between the entrance building and the mausoleum was taken up by a garden with water features including a narrow long channel at its axis and a reflecting pool in front of the mausoleum._x000D_
The existing mausoleum is just a part of the original layout. The whole western side of the lot, about 8 metres wide, was obliterated when the Salah Salem road was built. Only scant traces of the arcade once adjacent to the western wall of the mausoleum remain. The entrance building has been demolished, and the garden built up with nondescript structures, as was the eastern side of the front courtyard in front of the mausoleum. The arcaded courtyard east of the mausoleum has been covered with a roof; it is unknown how much of its colonnaded arcades are preserved (the unit was not accessible at the time of recording.)_x000D_

His father was a professor at al-Azhar; his grandfather Ahmad Pasha Mazhar Hasanein was the last Admiral of the Egyptian fleet. Hasanein Bey was educated in Cairo and graduated in 1914 from Balliol College at the University of Oxford. During the First World War he served as the Arab Secretary to General Maxwell, British Commanding Officer in Cairo in 1914. He was appointed a Member of the British Empire (MBE) and received the 1915 star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. (2)_x000D_
Hassanein Bey was a renowned explorer and published The Lost Oases (1925), which describes his 1923 journey of 2,200 miles by camel from the Egyptian port of Sollum on the shores of the Mediterranean to Al Obeid Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. He led the seven-month expedition which discovered the oases of Jebel Arkenu and Jebel Ouenat and he was awarded the Founder’s Medal by the Royal Geographical Society in 1924. (2)_x000D_
In 1924 he was appointed First Secretary of the Egyptian Legation in Washington, D.C. From 1925 to 1936 he was adviser to King Fuad and tutor of Crown Prince Faruk during his studies in London. He also served as Chamberlain to Queen Nazli between 1936 and 1946. He came to be considered one of the most influential men in Egypt (2)._x000D_
Hassanein Bey was an accomplished fencer and represented Egypt in the Olympic Games in Brussels 1920 and Paris 1924. (2) He was also a pilot (3)._x000D_
In 1926 he married Lutfia Hanim (born 1905), daughter of Seyfullah Yousri Pasha, first Egyptian Ambassador to Washington D.C., and Princess Shavikar Hanim Effendi, ex-wife of King Fuad. They later divorced. (3)_x000D_
Hassanein Bey died on 19 February 1946, killed in a car accident involving a British military vehicle. (2) The accident happened on the Qasr al-Nil Bridge in Cairo in rainy weather (3)._x000D_
Ahmad Hasanein was a brother-in-law to Hasan Fathi, the designer of the mausoleum. (1)_x000D_
The mausoleum was built with funding from the Egyptian government, then headed by the prime minister Mahmud Fahmy al-Nuqrashi [who is buried in a mausoleum nearby – record No 04], in recognition of Ahmad Hasanein’s lifelong contributions to Egypt (1, 3, 5).","•	(1) Serageldin, Ismail, ed.

There are no windows in the enclosure walls._x000D_
The entrance is from the southern side, in a wall apparently dating to the early 20th century, with the entrance gate, the corners, base course and cornice built of ashlar stone, and the rest of the wall built of rubble stone and plastered. The rectangular entrance door in covered with a monolithic stone lintel and is set in a recess in the wall which is not covered from above. Possibly it was originally intended as a neo-Mamluk portal taller than the rest of the wall (as in many neighbouring units) but was never completed. Over the door a modern marble plaque is mounted, with an incised inscription stating “tomb of the Pillar of Knowledge Shaykh al-Haddad and funerary enclosure of his children”. The inscription panel is apparently quite recent and mounted in a larger earlier recess over the door._x000D_
The section of the northern wall of the enclosure visible in the north-eastern corner and a short stretch of the eastern wall are built of ashlar masonry of decidedly Ottoman-period appearance and workmanship, with an engaged quarter-colonette in the corner with a simple (apparently altered) geometric-pattern capital. The wall continued further south, but was replaced with a rubble stone plastered wall that appears homogenous with the domed tomb adjoining it. To that wall the early 20th-century southern entrance façade was added._x000D_
The domed tomb is a rough and simplified replica (apparently mostly in brick) of the Mamluk-period stone mausolea abundant in the neighbourhood. The zone-of-transition is not architecturally distinguished room the cubical burial chamber, and consists of undecorated pyramidal shapes that transform the square plan of the chamber into an octagon under the dome drum. The windows in the zone-of-transition (which on the outside extend down below the corner “pyramids”) replicate the Mamluk one-over-two pattern of two arched windows and an oculus. The cylindrical drum is not distinguished from the dome itself and is pierced with eight small arched windows. The dome, of a slightly pointed profile similar to the Mamluk ones in topped with a brass “hilal” crescent finial. The exterior is plain, devoid of any architectural divisions or decoration except the entrance portal. The entrance from the courtyard is in the centre of the western wall, now accessed from a few steps down as the ground level has risen. It is a rectangular door with a stone lintel and the relieving arch above it framed in knotted mouldings of complex angular shapes typical of late-Ottoman architecture in Cairo. On the lintel is carved a frieze of simplified interlocking scrolls ending with palmettes, and on the relieving arch, a simple geometric pattern made up of extremely simplified floral motifs. There are no inscriptions. The decoration is obscured by layers of plaster and paint successively applied and removed. The windows in lateral walls are rectangular and plain, partially walled up as the ground level has risen._x000D_
The interior is plastered and completely plain, devoid of any decoration save the painted medallion of crudely painted extremely simplified floral pattern at the apex of the dome. There is no mihrab prayer niche. The dome rests on simple, undecorated squinches._x000D_
In the courtyard is a large low platform built of stone. According to the keeper, fourteen tombs are underneath, but there are no tomb markers._x000D_
Along the eastern wall of the enclosure, south of the mausoleum, is a small patch with a few trees and planted greenery.

The arch has no architectural decoration; its voissoirs are painted in imitation of ablaq masonry. The entrance is a rather simple two-leaved wrought iron openwork gate of Art Nouveau- inspired patterns, placed asymmetrically in the stone front wall. The right (western) side of the front courtyard is a narrow flower bed. In the middle of the courtyard is an opening of a crypt covered with concrete slabs, and to the east of it a modern brick-built uninscribed tomb marker. In the burial liwan, there is a simple undecorated and uninscribed marble tomb marker, with placements for shahid stelae that are missing. The walls of the liwan have colourful painted decoration. I consists of an imitation of multicolour stone dado in the lower part, inscription panels and roundels on the side walls, and an imitation of an inscribed lintel and a relieving arch over it over the rectangular window in the back wall, with calligraphic roundels to the sides of the window, which is fitted with a simple decorative wrought-iron grille. A painted medallion of geometric patterns is placed in the middle of the flat ceiling._x000D_
Attached to the east is a twin liwan, which is part of the neighbouring funerary enclosure marked by a modern plaque as belonging to the family of Muhammad Khalil. The original relation between the two structures is not clear.","There is serious damage to the lower parts of the walls caused by rising damp.

On each side of the main portal recess is a shallower full-height recess topped with a muqarnas frieze and containing single windows of the ground and upper floors. The ground-floor windows have Mamluk-profile inscription panels on their stone lintels and knotted moulding framing over the lintels and relieving arches like the entrance portal. The upper floor windows are plain, their lintels formed by flat arches of joggled voissoirs. The framing around the lintels is in the form of simple rectangular projecting bands. Similarly, the moulding over the entrance recess does not continue on its sides, and the galas benches on the sides of the door are similarly treated. This seems to indicate that the carving of the mouldings was not completed as planned. Stone fleur-de-lys crenellations are placed both on the slightly taller central section of the façade containing the portal, and the lower side sections._x000D_

The section of the wall over the gate is slightly taller; the undecorated gate is covered by a flat stone arch. Over the gate, a simple rectangular marble plaque is set in the wall, with an incised inscription stating that the burial ground belongs to the ancestors of the late Ms Basma Khatun and is affiliated to the Ministry of Awqaf (religious foundations.) Left of the gate is a single square window covered with a flat arch of bricks, opening on the courtyard. Both the gate and the window are fitted with openwork grilles of welded rolled steel in very simple geometric patterns. The southern wall of the enclosure is built of bricks and plastered, the western wall of dressed stone, and the northern wall of rubble stone. The eastern section of the enclosure, about five metres wide, is raised about 1.5 m above the rest of the open courtyard, which is accessed by a few steps. The raised platform was supported by a retaining wall, preserved only in the southern part built of ashlar stone masonry and apparently earlier than the present enclosure walls._x000D_
In the enclosure stand fifteen irregularly placed simple limestone cenotaphs with no inscriptions on their shahid stelae. On many, marble plaques with incised inscriptions are mounted, dating to the second half of the 20th century and as late as 2005. There appear to be remnants of two more destoyed ones in the north-eastern corner.

The main (eastern) façade is built of ashlar stone, other walls are built of rubble stone. The façade is in a style typical of the 1940s that uses simplified motifs of Islamic (primarily Mamluk) art composed in a way visibly inspired by modernist and Art Deco aesthetics. The middle section containing the entrance portal is slightly taller than the rest of the façade, from which it projects slightly, with the crowning courses overhanging on a two-tiered frieze of simple muqarnases.

The wooden shutters have their moulding-framed panels arranged in a simple decorative pattern._x000D_
In each of the side sections of the façade is a single rectangular window with a simple Classical cornice above.

Over the southern sabil window and over the secondary gate are placed modern, apparently quite recent, small square plaques of local substitute for marble.

The huge rectangular entrance door is covered with lintel formed by a flat arch of elaborately goggled vuossoirs, with a segmental relieving arch above. They are plain, without moulded framing. Above, there is a recess similar to Mamluk-period placements for an inscription panels, but it is empty. There are Mamluk-style gals benches to the sides of the door.The door leaves are shabby modern replacements. The front (eastern) façade is strictly symmetrical. On both sides of the portal, each section is divided into tree bays divided by flat projecting pilasters with no capitals and immediately adjacent strips built of ashlar stone masonry, and framed with three base courses and a top course with a cornice also built of ashlar stone, with the rest of the wall built in exposed and pointed rough stones. In the corners are squat engaged corner-columns. The bays nest to the portal have no openings; in each of the outer bays are two large plain rectangular windows with decorative grilles of wrought iron and fitted with simple louvre shutters (now in very poor condition of missing.) The side façades are irregular, with the windows next to the eastern corners placed in bays repeating the arrangement of the front façade, and back parts windows at various intervals._x000D_
In the middle of the northern façade is a secondary gate leading to the northern courtyard. It is set in a recess in a block of ashlar masonry that has gals seats to the sides (now covered with cement). Its plain rectangular opening is covered by a flat arch of joggled voussoirs, but the portal ends at this level. It appears that it was never completed._x000D_
The burial chamber in the north-western corner of the northern courtyard is entered from a portal in the eastern façade that is set in a recess topped with a muqarnas frieze. Its external walls are built of rough stone and plaster. In both northern and western walls are sets of double windows covered with round arches, with small oculi above them. The windows are fitted with very simple decorative grilles welded from rolled steel pieces, and with panelled wooden shutters including decorative mafruka motifs._x000D_
The burial chamber in the north-western corner of the southern courtyard is entered from a portal in its obliquely cut south-eastern corner. It has similar windows to this of the northern burial chamber, but with more elaborate wrought-iron grilles and with coloured glazing in frames divided into Islamic geomantic motifs in the windows’ arches. There is an octagonal wooden lantern covered with a wooden dome in the roof of this chamber._x000D_
In the south-western part of the southern courtyard, by the southern wall is a row of four large mastaba-like structures, apparently commemorative._x000D_
There are trees and other greenery in both courtyards, but not a formal garden layout._x000D_
The interior was inaccessible at the time of recording.","The complex is neglected and dilapidated. The entrance portal is very seriously tilted, leaning to the west towards the courtyard. There is serious damage from rising damp to the lower portions of the walls. All woodwork is damaged, desiccated, and largely missing.","According to the current keeper, the enclosure belonged to Fatma ‘Ali Hasan. On the secondary doorway in the northern façade is a modern plywood panel stating “funerary enclosure of Fatma Hasan Wasif”. However, there are no inscriptions on the main portal.",,89_DSC_1667s.JPG,,,,First half of the 20th century,89_DSC_1667ss.JPG

The free-standing structure (abutting to the east on a lower wall of neighbouring funerary enclosure) does not stand within any discernible walled enclosure. It is very simple, undecorated, and built entirely of wood. The ground floor is covered with vertical planks with laths covering the joints; the upper floor is of lath-and-plaster construction. The ground floor is L-shaped, so the entrance door, which faces south, is placed in the indented south-western corner under the overhanging upper storey. On the ground floor, there is a large window in each the western and the northern façades, with simple, undecorated steel grilles and simple panelled shutters. On the upper floor, there is a balcony running along the entire length of the western elevation, carried on three cantilevered wooden beams. It appears that the balcony was covered, probably by a lightweight trellis (the preserved corner posts are very slim.) The balustrade (still present along the front side in autumn 2015, but now preserved only on the northern side) is made of plain undecorated posts. The balcony is entered from a wide two-leaved door in the centre of the western wall. The simple panelled door is undecorated. There are two large windows in the northern elevation, and one small window in the southern one._x000D_
The interior was inaccessible at the time of recording.","The building is dilapidated and deteriorating. The roofing over the balcony and most of its balustrade are missing. All wood is desiccated. Plaster is almost completely missing from the lath-and-plaster walls of the upper storey. However, at some time in the past few years, the ground floor was painted white.",,,90_DSC_3415s.JPG,,,,First half of the 20th century,90_DSC_3420ss.jpg

There is a small single-storey building by the southern wall, consisting of an entrance hall in the eastern part and a room in the western part. The western part of the courtyard was covered with a lightweight wooden pergola (apparently with an octagonal roof lantern), of which scant remnants remain. In the middle of the main courtyard stands a cenotaph with calligraphic inscription panels in raised relief to its sides. The two shahid stelae are detached and stored in the courtyard. In the small back northern courtyard are two simple tomb markers._x000D_
The simple entrance gate is on the eastern side of the southern elevation. It is well-built of ashlar stone. The rectangular door is covered with a monolithic marble lintel, over which is a relieving arch. The lintel and arch are framed in knotted mouldings that end with complex eight-pointed star shapes typical of late-Ottoman period architecture in Cairo. On the lintel is a projecting carved panel with Ottoman-style motifs to the sides, and with a rectangular inscription panel in raised relief carved into it in the middle, giving the name Muhammad Ahmad Effendi and the date AH 1317. The incisions on the panel indicate that it was originally intended to include two lines of inscription in separate round-ended panels, which would give it a more Ottoman-like appearance. On the keystone of the relieving arch is a carved ornament with a five-pointed star at the top. It is obscured by a crudely mounted modern marble panel (undated) with an incised inscription referring to Muhammad Ahmad’s daughters. The steel door leaves are modern._x000D_
In the room in the south-western corner of the enclosure is a huge plain rectangular window in each western and southern wall, with non-decorative steel grilles and simple paneled shutters._x000D_
Save the entrance gate, the structure is built of rough stone, with external walls unplastered.","The structure receives basic maintenance. Its inner walls were recently re-plastered, and the joints of the outer walls smeared with cement. There is damage from rising damp and from rainwater.","The date AH 1317 in the inscription over the entrance corresponds to AD 1899_x000D_
The shahid stela stored in the main courtyard mentions two men deceased in AH 1323 and 1336 (AD 1905 and 1918 rexspectively).",,91_DSC_7789s.JPG,,,,AH 1317 = AD 1899,91_DSC_3745ss.jpg
