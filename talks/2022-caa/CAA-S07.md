Cultural heritage is a "shared heritage" (UNESCO, 1945), and managing it globally - at a large scale and over a longue durée - requires gathering information from heterogeneous and disparate sources, involves the integration of different software (databases, search engines, etc.), semantic data interoperability (open international standards, multilingual thesauri, etc.), and publishing policies (URI-based names, licenses, etc.). Nowadays, such aims require IT based on the semantic web (Bikakis et al., 2021), structured as a stack of technologies (Berners-Lee, 2013), supported by the concept of FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, Wilkinson et al., 2016) and described in Data Management Plans (DMP) along the following streams of application:  

* Data (re)use: use and reuse of data and metadata, describing sources, methods (remote sensing, ground surveys, etc.), software, format, and volume;
* Data register: describe data and metadata by controlled vocabularies (thesauri), based on ontologies (CIDOC-CRM, XML-TEI) and presented in information placeholders like dropdown lists;
* Data storage: database technologies (SQL, NoSQL), access policies, data versioning, backups and snapshots for short-, mid-, or long-term archives;
* Data analysis: analyses routine and data-driven documents, database auditing, machine learning (automatic site and change detection, etc.), knowledge discovery in databases and knowledge representation;
* Data sharing: access to publishing supports of raw or processed data or dataset through working papers, data paper (versioning), scientific papers referenced by URI-based names, how-to-cite documentation, licenses, GeoSPARQL and SPARQL endpoints.  

Achieving these objectives is per se a challenge. But additionally, new challenges arise when the concerned region is the global south. Such challenges are opportunities for geospatial semantic web-based purpose-built platforms (IT capacity vs digital gap), data access rules (ethical considerations, intellectual property, etc.), multi-linguism protocols, ground/remote sensing data quality control, recording condition assessments and threats over time (Rayne et al. 2017; Andreou et al. 2020; Fisher et al. 2021).  
  
This session welcomes papers addressing and demonstrating a successful workflow on collecting, registering, storing, analysing, and sharing knowledge on immovable cultural heritage in the global south, especially for condition and risk assessment of archaeological sites, using standard ontology. Papers should address one or more aspects of these topics, the entire workflow, or emerging issues such as web3D, image annotation, heritage BIMs. Participation is encouraged for institutional projects at the supranational and national levels, or over multi-paradigm, to inform the upcoming emerging challenges of geospatial semantic web-based purpose-built platforms over the borders.
