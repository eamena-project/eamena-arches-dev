I need some of you to take in charge the 4 **TODO** points listed here below:

* https://eamena-project.github.io/eamena-arches-dev/talks/2023-gmpca/pres/#/endangered-archaeology-in-middle-east-and-north-africa
    - tab `War`: this is the way I want to present all the threats (captions and interactive maps)
    - tab `Agriculture`: **TODO** -> (1) change the caption and (2) change the coordinates which aren't accurate. For the latter: does someone knows the accurate coordinates of the 'Archaeological site (Udhma, Jordan)', currently https://github.com/eamena-project/eamena-arches-dev/blob/2ab3b2d9854ffa5b867674274197cd46cecf010f/talks/2023-gmpca/index.qmd#L105
    - tab `Construction`: **TODO** -> (1) change the caption and (2) change the coordinates which aren't accurate, currently https://github.com/eamena-project/eamena-arches-dev/blob/main/talks/2023-gmpca/index.qmd#L141
    - tab `Natural`: **TODO** -> (1) change the caption and (2) change the coordinates which aren't accurate, currently https://github.com/eamena-project/eamena-arches-dev/blob/main/talks/2023-gmpca/index.qmd#L177 and (3) the photograph is ugly, can someone send me a nicer?

    - **TODO** -> the CPF photograph is a screenshot, can someone send me the original one?
